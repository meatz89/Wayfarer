   - FAILURE: Show how the character failed but what they might have learned
   - PARTIAL: Show how the character partially achieved the request with limitations
   - STANDARD: Demonstrate full achievement of the request as intended
   - EXCEPTIONAL: Show how the character not only achieved the request but gained additional benefits
