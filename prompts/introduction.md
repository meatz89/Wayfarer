# WAYFARER ENCOUNTER SETUP

Create an immersive introductory scene for a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter in a {LOCATION_NAME}. The character is a {CHARACTER_ARCHETYPE} with {APPROACH_STATS} seeking to {CHARACTER_GOAL}.

The location contains {ENVIRONMENT_DETAILS} and key NPCs include {NPC_LIST}. The character faces {TIME_CONSTRAINTS} and {ADDITIONAL_CHALLENGES}.

Write 2-3 paragraphs that:
1. Establish the scene using multiple sensory details across at least three senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste)
2. Introduce NPCs through observable behaviors and subtle psychological cues that hint at their motivations
3. Present the objective as an organic part of the narrative while subtly indicating which approaches might be effective
4. Create environmental elements that could be strategically utilized or that might pose challenges
5. End with a clear situation that requires a decision - make this final paragraph present a specific problem or challenge

Additional requirements:
- Create environmental elements that naturally align with strategic tag effects (e.g., if Precision decreases pressure, include details that reward careful approaches)
- Show NPC personalities through micro-expressions, posture, and behavior patterns
- Include at least 3 distinct sensory details from different senses
- Plant subtle hints about effective approaches without explicitly stating them
- Suggest multiple possible paths forward aligned with different approach types

Remember:
- Focus on BASIC SURVIVAL and PRACTICAL CHALLENGES, not comfort
- Portray medieval life as DIFFICULT and HARSH
- The character is a SOLITARY TRAVELER with NO COMPANIONS
- Write in PRESENT TENSE and FIRST PERSON
- Focus on CONCRETE DETAILS, not abstract concepts
- Use language appropriate to a common medieval traveler
- DO NOT include any numbered or bulleted choices in your response
- Your final paragraph MUST present a clear problem requiring decision

The tone should match a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter - [for Rapport: conversational and interpersonal; for Intellectual: analytical and observational; for Physical: action-oriented and environmental].
