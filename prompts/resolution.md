# WAYFARER TURN RESOLUTION

{ENCOUNTER_HISTORY}

Generate a narrative outcome for a character in a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter who JUST chose {SELECTED_CHOICE} ({APPROACH} + {FOCUS}, {EFFECT_TYPE}). The encounter takes place in {LOCATION} with the objective to {CHARACTER_GOAL}.

Urgent situation that prompted the choice: {CURRENT_SITUATION}

Player's choice description: {CHOICE_DESCRIPTION}

Previous state: Momentum {M_OLD}, Pressure {P_OLD}
New state: Momentum {M_NEW}, Pressure {P_NEW}
Approach changes: {APPROACH_CHANGES}
Focus changes: {FOCUS_CHANGES}
Narrative tags activated: {NEW_NARRATIVE_TAGS}
Strategic effects triggered: {STRATEGIC_EFFECTS}
Turn: {CURRENT_TURN} of {MAX_TURNS}

Write a continuous narrative response that follows this structure (but DO NOT include any section labels or headings):

First 2-3 paragraphs: 
- Show the immediate results of this choice through detailed description
- Demonstrate how the approach increase manifests as developing skill or mastery, not just a numeric change
- Illustrate the focus increase through selective attention or enhanced capability
- Represent momentum/pressure changes through narrative developments with clear cause-effect relationships
- If narrative tags activated, subtly show their effects emerging as natural limitations
- Include NPC reactions with psychological depth (thoughts, emotions, calculations visible through expressions)
- Show how strategic tag effects manifest through environmental or situational responses
- Reference how previous choices and their consequences continue to influence the current situation

Final paragraph: 
- Present a NEW DIRECT PROBLEM that emerges as a direct result of the action just taken
- Create multiple potential pathways forward (breadcrumbs) aligned with different approaches
- Update NPC positions/attitudes with psychological nuance
- Introduce new environmental elements or changes to existing ones
- Subtly hint at which approaches might be particularly effective
- If near end (turn {CURRENT_TURN}/{MAX_TURNS}), increase tension appropriately
- Make the problem different from previous challenges, create urgency, and directly relate to what just happened

REMEMBER:
- This is the FIRST TIME this action is being described - it is NOT a summary of past events
- Write in FIRST PERSON, PRESENT TENSE as the action unfolds NOW
- Write as a continuous narrative with NO section headings, labels, or breaks
- Be historically accurate to medieval life
- Focus on ordinary challenges, not heroic or epic quests
- The character is a solitary traveler seeking modest security
- Include sensory details and physical sensations
- Show a DIRECT progression from the player's choice
- The final paragraph MUST present a clear problem requiring immediate action
- Create a NEW problem that is DIFFERENT from the previous urgent situation

Maintain the tone appropriate for a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter.
