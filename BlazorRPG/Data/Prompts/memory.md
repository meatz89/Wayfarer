## MEMORY FILE CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES

### SECTION CREATION RULES
- Each section represents a critical narrative domain
- Use clear, descriptive section headers

  * Outdated plot points
  * Resolved mysteries
  * Stale character information
  * Irrelevant background details
- RETAIN:

  * Unresolved mysteries with potential impact

### UPDATE METHODOLOGY
- When new information arrives:
  * Integrate IMMEDIATELY into appropriate sections

  * Add new bullet points for significant discoveries
  * Ensure NO REDUNDANT information remains
