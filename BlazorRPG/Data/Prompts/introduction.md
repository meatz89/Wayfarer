# ENCOUNTER INTRODUCTION

Create a BRIEF, immersive introductory scene for the Encounter at this location and spot. Keep it short. No more than 4 paragraphs.
Talk in the voice of the player character archetype. The narration of a Warrior, Scholar, Courtier, Ranger, Mystic, and Diplomat should be remarkably different.

CRITICAL: Do not spell out to the player that he will have to make a decision. Do not end with explicit questions about what to do next. Do not have the character pre-decide on specific interactions or commit to particular courses of action.

{PROMPT_CONTEXT}

## Narrative Boundaries
- Present the situation appropriately for the encounter context
- Show the character's observations and internal perspective
- DO NOT have the character decide to interact with specific people or objects
- DO NOT commit the character to any particular course of action
- DO NOT end with explicit questions like "Do I approach X or Y?"
- Let the situation speak for itself - if it's dangerous, show the danger; if it's peaceful, show the opportunities

## Context-Appropriate Endings
- For peaceful/social encounters: End with the character taking in available opportunities
- For dangerous/urgent encounters: End with the character facing the immediate threat or challenge  
- For puzzle/investigation encounters: End with the character confronting the mystery or problem
- Match the ending to what the situation actually demands

## EncounterContext Clarification
- Make clear what success would accomplish through the SPECIFIC chosen approach
- Hint at consequences of failure for this particular approach
- The scene should directly set up the chosen approach method, not generic action possibilities
- Incorporate relevant details from the character's past experiences

## Chekhov's Gun Integration
1. SELECT 0-1 Chekhov's Guns from the list that would naturally fit this encounter
2. If including a Chekhov's Gun:
   - For Introduced elements: Reference and develop them further
   - For Developed elements: Advance them meaningfully
   - For Fired elements: Only reference if directly relevant
   - ONLY Resolve an element if this encounterContext naturally concludes its arc
3. Never force inclusion if it doesn't fit the encounterContext context
4. The Chekhov's Gun should enhance but not dominate the primary encounterContext goal

## General Requirements
1. Reference at least 1-2 specific details from the memory file
2. Use multiple sensory details across at least three senses
3. Show NPCs through observable behaviors that hint at motivations
4. End with the character observing the scene, NOT making decisions about what to do next
5. Write in first-person present tense from a medieval perspective
6. Include environmental elements that align with the chosen approach's tags
7. Present opportunities without committing to them
