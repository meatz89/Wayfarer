Your memory of past events:
"{MEMORY_CONTENT}"

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: This scene MUST continue directly from previous events. You MUST weave in at least 3-4 specific details from the memory file, including:
1. Direct references to previous locations or encounters
2. Physical or emotional states resulting from prior events
3. Knowledge or insights gained from previous successes/failures
4. How previous events have changed the character's approach

Create an immersive introductory scene for a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter at the {LOCATION_SPOT} of the {LOCATION_NAME}.
The player is a {CHARACTER_ARCHETYPE} who just came from the events described in the memory (skip if no memory is provided) and is now seeking to {CHARACTER_GOAL}.
The player character is facing the immediate challenge that {ENCOUNTER_COMPLICATION}, which connects to their previous experiences.

The location contains {ENVIRONMENT_DETAILS} and key NPCs include {NPC_LIST}. The character faces {TIME_CONSTRAINTS} and {ADDITIONAL_CHALLENGES}.

Write 2-3 paragraphs that:
1. Establish the scene using multiple sensory details across at least three senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) while explicitly connecting to previous events
2. Introduce NPCs through observable behaviors that hint at their motivations, relating to any relevant previous encounters
3. Present the objective as an organic part of the narrative while subtly indicating which approaches might be effective based on lessons from previous attempts
4. Create environmental elements that could be strategically utilized or might pose challenges
5. End with a clear situation that requires a decision, directly shaped by previous experiences

EXAMPLES OF PROPER CONTINUITY:
- "My hands still shake from the bandit confrontation as I reach the library entrance."
- "After failing to get through the market alleys, this new path to the library seems more promising."
- "The cut on my arm from the earlier struggle reminds me to be more cautious this time."

Additional requirements:
- Begin with a direct transition from the previous location/encounter in the memory file (skip if no memory is provided)
- Show how the character's physical and mental state reflects previous events
- Create environmental elements that naturally align with strategic tag effects
- Show NPC personalities through observable behaviors and reactions
- Include at least 3 distinct sensory details from different senses
- Plant subtle hints about effective approaches without explicitly stating them
- Suggest multiple possible paths forward aligned with different approach types

Remember:
- MANDATORY: Create explicit narrative continuity with the memory file contents (skip if no memory is provided)
- Focus on BASIC SURVIVAL and PRACTICAL CHALLENGES, not comfort
- Portray medieval life as DIFFICULT and HARSH
- The character is a SOLITARY TRAVELER with NO COMPANIONS
- PRESENT TENSE and FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE
- Focus on CONCRETE DETAILS, not abstract concepts
- Use language appropriate to a common medieval traveler
- DO NOT include any numbered or bulleted choices in your response
- Your final paragraph MUST present a clear problem requiring decision
- DO NOT REFERENCE PAST EVENTS OR MEMORIES IF NO MEMORY FILE IS PROVIDED
- YOUR ENTIRE OUTPUT WILL BE DISPLAYED DIRECTLY TO THE USER. Do NOT acknowledge these instructions in your response. ONLY CREATE THE INTROUCTION

The tone should match a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter - [for Social: conversational and interpersonal; for Intellectual: analytical and observational; for Physical: action-oriented and environmental].
