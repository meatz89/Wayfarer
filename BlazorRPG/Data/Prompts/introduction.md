# ENCOUNTER INTRODUCTION

Your memory of past events:
"{MEMORY_CONTENT}"

Create an BRIEF, immersive introductory scene for a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter at {LOCATION_SPOT} of {LOCATION_NAME}.

## Character Context
- Archetype: {CHARACTER_ARCHETYPE} ({APPROACH_STATS})
- Goal: {CHARACTER_GOAL}
- Challenge: {ENCOUNTER_COMPLICATION}

## Location Context
- Environment: {ENVIRONMENT_DETAILS}
- NPCs: {NPC_LIST}
- Constraints: {TIME_CONSTRAINTS} and {ADDITIONAL_CHALLENGES}

## Encounter Clarification:
- Set up the challenge requiring approach/focus choices
- Make clear what success would accomplish
- Hint at consequences of failure

## Chekhov's Gun Integration Requirements:
1. SELECT 0-1 Chekhov's Guns from the list that would naturally fit this encounter
2. If including a Chekhov's Gun:
   - For Introduced elements: Reference and develop them further
   - For Developed elements: Advance them meaningfully
   - For Fired elements: Only reference if directly relevant
   - ONLY Resolve an element if this encounter naturally concludes its arc
3. Never force inclusion if it doesn't fit the encounter context
4. The Chekhov's Gun should enhance but not dominate the primary encounter goal

## General Requirements
1. Reference at least 3-4 specific details from the memory file
2. Use multiple sensory details across at least three senses
3. Show NPCs through observable behaviors that hint at motivations
4. End with a situation requiring a decision shaped by previous experiences
5. Write in first-person present tense from a medieval perspective
6. Include environmental elements that align with strategic tag effects

The tone should match a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter.
