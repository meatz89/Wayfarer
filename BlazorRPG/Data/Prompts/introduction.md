# ENCOUNTER INTRODUCTION
Create a BRIEF, immersive introductory scene for a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter at {LOCATION_SPOT} of {LOCATION_NAME}.
Talk in the voice of the player character archetype. The narration of a warrior, scholar, ranger, bard and thief should be remarkably different.

## Player Character Status
{PLAYER_STATUS}

## Location Context
- Environment: {ENVIRONMENT_DETAILS}
- NPCs: {NPC_LIST}
- Constraints: {TIME_CONSTRAINTS} and {ADDITIONAL_CHALLENGES}

## Resource Guidelines
- Only mention player's resources (coins, health, energy, etc.) if directly relevant
- Only reference inventory items when naturally applicable to the situation
- If the encounter involves purchasing or trading, subtly establish spending context without stating exact coin amounts
- Reflect resource limitations (low health, energy, etc.) through character's feelings or physical state rather than numbers

## Encounter Clarification
- Set up the challenge requiring approach/focus choices
- Make clear what success would accomplish
- Hint at consequences of failure

## Chekhov's Gun Integration
1. SELECT 0-1 Chekhov's Guns from the list that would naturally fit this encounter
2. If including a Chekhov's Gun:
   - For Introduced elements: Reference and develop them further
   - For Developed elements: Advance them meaningfully
   - For Fired elements: Only reference if directly relevant
   - ONLY Resolve an element if this encounter naturally concludes its arc
3. Never force inclusion if it doesn't fit the encounter context
4. The Chekhov's Gun should enhance but not dominate the primary encounter goal

## General Requirements
1. Reference at least 1-2 specific details from the memory file
2. Use multiple sensory details across at least three senses
3. Show NPCs through observable behaviors that hint at motivations
4. End with a situation requiring a decision shaped by previous experiences
5. Write in first-person present tense from a medieval perspective
6. Include environmental elements that align with strategic tag effects

The tone should match a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter.
