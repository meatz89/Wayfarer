# ENCOUNTER INTRODUCTION

Create a BRIEF introductory scene that establishes:
1. The immediate environment through the character archetype's perspective
2. One specific situation or opportunity requiring the player's attention
3. The character's current position and what they can observe

CRITICAL: Do not have the character pre-decide actions or end with questions.

{PROMPT_CONTEXT}

## Narrative Boundaries
- Present the situation appropriately for the encounter context
- Show the character's observations and internal perspective
- DO NOT have the character decide to interact with specific people or objects
- DO NOT commit the character to any particular course of action
- DO NOT end with explicit questions like "Do I approach X or Y?"
- Let the situation speak for itself - if it's dangerous, show the danger; if it's peaceful, show the opportunities

## Context-Appropriate Endings
- For peaceful/social encounters: End with the character taking in available opportunities
- For dangerous/urgent encounters: End with the character facing the immediate threat or challenge  
- For puzzle/investigation encounters: End with the character confronting the mystery or problem
- Match the ending to what the situation actually demands

## EncounterContext Clarification
- Make clear what success would accomplish through the SPECIFIC chosen approach
- Hint at consequences of failure for this particular approach
- The scene should directly set up the chosen approach method, not generic action possibilities
- Incorporate relevant details from the character's past experiences

## Chekhov's Gun Integration
1. SELECT 0-1 Chekhov's Guns from the list that would naturally fit this encounter
2. If including a Chekhov's Gun:
   - For Introduced elements: Reference and develop them further
   - For Developed elements: Advance them meaningfully
   - For Fired elements: Only reference if directly relevant
   - ONLY Resolve an element if this encounterContext naturally concludes its arc
3. Never force inclusion if it doesn't fit the encounterContext context
4. The Chekhov's Gun should enhance but not dominate the primary encounterContext goal

## General Requirements
1. Reference at least 1-2 specific details from the memory file
2. Use multiple sensory details across at least three senses
3. Show NPCs through observable behaviors that hint at motivations
4. End with the character observing the scene, NOT making decisions about what to do next
5. Write in first-person present tense from a medieval perspective
6. Include environmental elements that align with the chosen approach's tags
7. Present opportunities without committing to them
