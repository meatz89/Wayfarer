# ENCOUNTER INTRODUCTION
Create a BRIEF, immersive introductory scene for a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter at {LOCATION_SPOT} of {LOCATION_NAME}.
Talk in the voice of the player character archetype. The narration of a warrior, scholar, ranger, bard and thief should be remarkably different.

## Player Character Status
{PLAYER_STATUS}

## Location Context
- Environment: {ENVIRONMENT_DETAILS}
- NPCs: {NPC_LIST}
- Constraints: {TIME_CONSTRAINTS} and {ADDITIONAL_CHALLENGES}

## Resource Guidelines
- Only mention player's resources (coins, health, energy, etc.) if directly relevant
- Only reference inventory items when naturally applicable to the situation
- If the encounter involves purchasing or trading, subtly establish spending context without stating exact coin amounts
- Reflect resource limitations (low health, energy, etc.) through character's feelings or physical state rather than numbers

## Encounter Clarification
- Make clear what success would accomplish
- Hint at consequences of failure

## Chekhov's Gun Integration
1. SELECT 0-1 Chekhov's Guns from the list that would naturally fit this encounter
2. If including a Chekhov's Gun:
   - For Introduced elements: Reference and develop them further
   - For Developed elements: Advance them meaningfully
   - For Fired elements: Only reference if directly relevant
   - ONLY Resolve an element if this encounter naturally concludes its arc
3. Never force inclusion if it doesn't fit the encounter context
4. The Chekhov's Gun should enhance but not dominate the primary encounter goal

## Conflict Generation
Based on the location, encounter type, and context, create an appropriate conflict situation. Here are some examples:
- OPPOSING CHARACTERS: Two NPCs with conflicting goals, both with legitimate perspectives
- public TENSION: A single NPC with a conflicting public struggle that involves the player
- ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURE: A situation where the environment itself creates urgency and tension
- MORAL DILEMMA: A scenario requiring the player to choose between competing values
- HIDDEN AGENDA: A seemingly straightforward situation with concealed motives or information
- RESOURCE SCARCITY: Multiple parties competing for limited resources or opportunities

The selected conflict should:
- Arise NATURALLY from the location and context (never force a conflict type)
- Create meaningful STAKES for success or failure
- Offer multiple VIABLE approaches to resolution
- Introduce TENSION appropriate to the encounter type

## General Requirements
1. Reference at least 1-2 specific details from the memory file
2. Use multiple sensory details across at least three senses
3. Show NPCs through observable behaviors that hint at motivations
4. End with a situation requiring a decision shaped by previous experiences
5. Write in first-person present tense from a medieval perspective
6. Include environmental elements that align with strategic tag effects
7. Ensure characters have understandable motivations where neither is clearly "right"
8. Use weather, lighting, or architecture to enhance the mood of confrontation
9. The player's potential choices should involve complicated moral considerations

The tone should match a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounter.
