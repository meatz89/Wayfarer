# ENCOUNTER INTRODUCTION
Create a BRIEF introductory scene that establishes:
1. The immediate environment through the character archetype's perspective
2. One specific situation or opportunity requiring the player's attention
3. The character's current position and what they can observe

CRITICAL: Do not have the character pre-decide actions or end with questions.

{PROMPT_CONTEXT}

## Narrative Boundaries
- Present the situation appropriately for the encounter context
- Show the character's observations and internal perspective
- DO NOT have the character decide to interact with specific people or objects
- DO NOT commit the character to any particular course of action
- DO NOT end with explicit questions like "Do I approach X or Y?"
- Let the situation speak for itself through demonstrated stakes and opportunities

## Context-Appropriate Endings
Match the ending to the encounter's actual demands:
- Peaceful encounters: End with character observing available opportunities
- Urgent encounters: End with character facing immediate challenge
- Investigation encounters: End with character confronting the mystery
- Social encounters: End with character positioned within the social dynamic

## EncounterContext Integration
- Make clear what success would accomplish through the SPECIFIC chosen approach
- Hint at consequences of failure for this particular approach
- Set up the chosen approach method directly, not generic possibilities
- Incorporate relevant details from the character's past experiences

## Chekhov's Gun Integration
1. SELECT 0-1 Chekhov's Guns from the list that naturally fit this encounter
2. If including:
   - Introduced elements: Reference and develop further
   - Developed elements: Advance meaningfully
   - Fired elements: Reference only if directly relevant
   - ONLY Resolve if this encounter naturally concludes the arc
3. Never force inclusion if it doesn't fit the context
4. Enhancement, not dominance of the primary encounter goal

## Requirements
1. Reference 1-2 specific details from the memory file
2. Use sensory details across at least three senses
3. Show NPCs through observable behaviors that hint at motivations
4. End with character observing the scene, NOT making decisions
5. Write in first-person present tense from medieval perspective
6. Include environmental elements aligned with the chosen approach's tags
7. Present opportunities without committing to them
