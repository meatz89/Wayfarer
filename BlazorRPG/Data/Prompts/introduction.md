# ENCOUNTER INTRODUCTION

Create a BRIEF, immersive introductory scene for the Encounter at this location and spot.
Talk in the voice of the player character archetype. The narration of a Warrior, Scholar, Courtier, Ranger, Mystic, and Diplomat should be remarkably different.

{PROMPT_CONTEXT}

## EncounterContext Clarification
- Make clear what success would accomplish through the SPECIFIC chosen approach
- Hint at consequences of failure for this particular approach
- The scene should directly set up the chosen approach method, not generic action possibilities
- Incorporate relevant details from the character's past experiences:

## Chekhov's Gun Integration
1. SELECT 0-1 Chekhov's Guns from the list that would naturally fit this encounter
2. If including a Chekhov's Gun:
   - For Introduced elements: Reference and develop them further
   - For Developed elements: Advance them meaningfully
   - For Fired elements: Only reference if directly relevant
   - ONLY Resolve an element if this encounterContext naturally concludes its arc
3. Never force inclusion if it doesn't fit the encounterContext context
4. The Chekhov's Gun should enhance but not dominate the primary encounterContext goal

## Conflict Generation
Based on the location, encounterContext type, and CHOSEN APPROACH, create an appropriate conflict situation.

The selected conflict should:
- Arise NATURALLY from the approach the player has chosen
- Create meaningful STAKES for success or failure with this specific approach
- Offer multiple viable ways to use this particular approach
- Introduce TENSION appropriate to a {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} encounterContext using the player's chosen method

## General Requirements
1. Reference at least 1-2 specific details from the memory file
2. Use multiple sensory details across at least three senses
3. Show NPCs through observable behaviors that hint at motivations
4. End with a situation requiring a decision shaped by previous experiences AND the chosen approach
5. Write in first-person present tense from a medieval perspective
6. Include environmental elements that align with the chosen approach's tags
7. Ensure characters have understandable motivations where neither is clearly "right"
8. Use weather, lighting, or architecture to enhance the mood of confrontation
9. The player's potential choices should involve complicated moral considerations within their chosen approach
