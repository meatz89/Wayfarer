# ENCOUNTER INTRODUCTION
Create a BRIEF introductory scene (2-3 paragraphs maximum) that establishes:
1. The immediate environment through the character archetype's perspective
2. One specific situation or opportunity requiring the player's attention
3. The character's current position and what they can observe

CRITICAL: Do not have the character pre-decide actions or end with questions.

{PROMPT_CONTEXT}

## ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS
- If "NPCs Present: None" then NO NPCs exist in this scene
- If "No memories available" then NO references to character's past
- If NPCs are listed, only those NPCs exist
- Never add elements not explicitly provided in the context

## Narrative Boundaries
- Present the situation appropriately for the encounter context
- Show the character's observations and internal perspective
- DO NOT have the character decide to interact with specific people or objects
- DO NOT commit the character to any particular course of action
- DO NOT end with explicit questions like "Do I approach X or Y?"
- Let the situation speak for itself through demonstrated stakes and opportunities

## Context-Appropriate Endings
Match the ending to the encounter's actual demands:
- Peaceful encounters: End with character observing available opportunities
- Urgent encounters: End with character facing immediate challenge
- Investigation encounters: End with character confronting the mystery
- Social encounters: End with character positioned within the social dynamic

## EncounterContext Integration
- Make clear what success would accomplish through the SPECIFIC chosen approach
- Hint at consequences of failure for this particular approach
- Set up the chosen approach method directly, not generic possibilities
- Only incorporate character details if memories are explicitly provided

## Memory Integration Rules
- If memories exist: Reference 1-2 specific details from the memory file
- If no memories exist: Establish character perspective through immediate observations only
- Never invent character history not provided in memories

## Requirements
1. Apply memory rules as specified above
2. Use sensory details across at least three senses
3. Show only NPCs explicitly listed in "NPCs Present"
4. End with character observing the scene, NOT making decisions
5. Write in first-person present tense from medieval perspective
6. Include environmental elements aligned with the chosen approach
7. Present opportunities without committing to them
