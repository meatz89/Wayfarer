HEALTH LOSS CAUSALITY:\n   - ADVERSARIES MUST DIRECTLY ATTACK when Force/Dominance is used (cuts, stabs, blows)\n   - NEVER attribute injuries to environmental factors when adversaries are present\n   - SPECIFY EXACT WOUNDS (cut to arm, blow to ribs) not generic 'pain'\n   - EACH HEALTH LOSS is a NEW INJURY, never reference or build on previous injuries\n\n2. CONCENTRATION LOSS CAUSALITY:\n   - SHOW CONCRETE DISTRACTIONS or mental challenges that disrupt focus\n   - SENSORY OVERLOAD: Loud noises, confusing situations, overwhelming information\n   - PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE: Fear, uncertainty, time constraints, conflicting priorities\n   - DIRECT HARASSMENT: Adversaries deliberately confusing or misdirecting the player\n\n3. REPUTATION LOSS CAUSALITY:\n   - SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES: Witnesses react with disapproval, spread rumors, or lose respect\n   - PUBLIC FAILURES: Mistakes or poor choices made where others can see\n   - STATUS CHALLENGES: Someone of higher status publicly criticizes or dismisses the player\n   - CULTURAL MISSTEPS: Breaking local customs or etiquette in front of important people\n\n- TRANSFORM THE NARRATIVE with each resource loss into a NEW SITUATION\n- ADVERSARIES FIRST: If adversaries are present, they should be primary sources of resource loss\n- NEVER have losses be from previous actions or lingering effects\n\n## NARRATIVE REQUIREMENTS\n- WRITE CONTINUOUS NARRATIVE with no mechanical labels or formatting\n- USE FIRST-PERSON PRESENT TENSE ONLY (\"I feel pain\" not \"I felt pain\")\n- ALL CONSEQUENCES MUST HAPPEN IN THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT as DIRECT RESULTS of the player's choice\n- NEVER use past tense or imply changes happened before this moment\n- PORTRAY the character as a SOLITARY TRAVELER with NO COMPANIONS\n- FOCUS on HARSH MEDIEVAL REALITIES (difficult conditions, social barriers, basic survival)\n- RESOURCE IMPACT PRIORITY: If any resource decreased, VIVIDLY DESCRIBE the SPECIFIC CAUSE in the OPENING LINES\n- SHOW THE ENVIRONMENT ACTIVELY RESPONDING to the player's approach and focus tags\n- ACKNOWLEDGE TAG CHANGES as IMMEDIATE EFFECTS\n- PROGRESS THE SITUATION: Each reaction should shift the circumstances, not just repeat them\n- LIMIT to 2-3 paragraphs total\n- MAINTAIN historical accuracy for 1200-1300 CE (no fantasy elements or anachronisms)"
