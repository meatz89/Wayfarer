# NARRATIVE REACTION

## Player's Choice
'{SELECTED_CHOICE}' ({CHOICE_DESCRIPTION})
CRITICAL: This choice represents the player's INTENT only, not what actually happens. The actual outcome must be driven by the mechanical changes below.

## Mechanical Changes (Must Be Reflected In Narrative)
- Momentum: {OLD_MOMENTUM} → {NEW_MOMENTUM}/{MAX_MOMENTUM}
- Pressure: {OLD_PRESSURE} → {NEW_PRESSURE}/{MAX_PRESSURE}
- Resources: Health {HEALTH_CHANGE}, Confidence {CONFIDENCE_CHANGE}, Concentration {CONCENTRATION_CHANGE}
- Approach Changes: {APPROACH_CHANGES} | Focus Changes: {FOCUS_CHANGES}
- New Tags: {NEW_TAGS_ACTIVATED}
- Strategic Effects: {STRATEGIC_EFFECTS}

## Encounter Context
- Type: {ENCOUNTER_TYPE} | Turn: {CURRENT_TURN}/{MAX_TURNS} | Stage: {ENCOUNTER_STAGE}
- Goal: {CHARACTER_GOAL}
- Character Status: {INJURIES/STATUS}

## Character Continuity
- Limit new NAMED characters to 1-2 per encounter (not per turn)
- Focus primarily on developing characters already established in previous turns
- Feel free to include unnamed villagers, patrons, guards, etc. as needed
- Background characters can take actions and react, but keep the focus on main NPCs
- When introducing a named character, give them distinctive traits and motivations

## NPC CHARACTERIZATION
- NPCs must act with agency and pursue their own goals
- Show emotions through physical details (gestures, expressions, posture)
- NPCs should speak in distinctive voices appropriate to their character
- Every turn, NPCs must take at least one independent action
- NPCs should influence and utilize the environment

## Writing Requirements
Write three paragraphs in first-person present tense:
1. Show the player's attempted action and the ACTUAL results (which may differ from expectations)
2. Demonstrate situation evolution with NPCs taking independent actions
3. Present a new challenge requiring decision with NPC involvement

## Narrative Implementation of Mechanical Changes:
- MOMENTUM CHANGES must be shown as progress (or setbacks) toward the character's goal
- PRESSURE CHANGES must be reflected as situational escalation or de-escalation
- RESOURCE CHANGES (Health/Confidence/Concentration) are CRITICALLY IMPORTANT and must be shown as actual injuries or impacts to the character
- APPROACH CHANGES must be reflected in how the environment and NPCs react to the player
- NEW TAGS must manifest as situational constraints or new opportunities
- STRATEGIC EFFECTS must be shown as contextual advantages or disadvantages

Start with acknowledging the player's intent, but then show what ACTUALLY happens based on the mechanical outcomes.
