- Pressure Change: {PRESSURE_CHANGE} (Previous: {OLD_PRESSURE}, New: {NEW_PRESSURE})
- Approach Changes: {APPROACH_CHANGES}
- Focus Changes: {FOCUS_CHANGES}
- Resource Changes: Health {HEALTH_CHANGE}, Confidence {CONFIDENCE_CHANGE}, Concentration {CONCENTRATION_CHANGE}
- New Tags Activated: '{NEW_TAGS_ACTIVATED}'
- Strategic Effects: '{STRATEGIC_EFFECTS}'

ENCOUNTER CONTEXT:
- Player Character (PC) Goal: '{CHARACTER_GOAL}'
- Player Condition: '{INJURIES/STATUS}'

NPC CHARACTERIZATION:
- Each NPC should act with their own agency and initiative
- NPCs must pursue their own goals, not just react to the player
- Show NPC emotions through physical details (gestures, expressions, posture)
- NPCs should speak in distinctive voices appropriate to their character
- Include specific character details that bring NPCs to life
- Every turn, NPCs must take at least one independent action
- For threatening NPCs: maintain genuine danger through actions and dialogue
- NPCs should influence and utilize the environment

NARRATIVE STRUCTURE:
Write three paragraphs in first-person present tense from a medieval commoner's perspective:
1. Show the chosen action and immediate results. NPCs' may have immediate reactions to it (this action has NOT happened yet)
2. Demonstrate how the situation evolves as a consequence. NPCs may take independent actions
3. Present the new challenge requiring a decision. NPCs may create or influence the decision point
  
KEY REQUIREMENTS:
- The chosen action has NOT HAPPENED YET. Begin with the player's physical action from the chosen option
- The narrative is told from the PC's first person perspective. ONLY write in the narrative what the player may reasonably know, i.e from the memory or the encounter history
- Show how the selected approach+focus combination manifests in the PC's actions
- Demonstrate the outcomes mechanically indicated (momentum/pressure/resource changes)
- If new tags activated, subtly show their effects from the PC's perspective
- Present a new situation that logically follows from these developments
- NPCs must respond in ways consistent with their established character
- Show NPCs making decisions and taking actions of their own
- Include physical details that reveal NPC emotions and intentions
- For dialogue, use language appropriate to each character's status and personality
- Environmental elements should be utilized by both player and NPCs
- For early-stage encounters, establish the encounter complication related to the player goal. May involve NPCs and their intentions
- For mid-stage Encounters, develop the narrative threats. May involve NPC responses and complications
- For late-stage encounters, work toward appropriate resolution. May include NPC involvement
  * High Momentum: Player is close to reaching his goal
  * High Pressure: Player is losing control of the situation
  * Final Turn: Conclude based on momentum vs. success threshold
- Maintain grounded, medieval perspective throughout
- End with a clear decision point with multiple possible approaches

Write with medieval language appropriate to the encounter type:
- Physical: Action-oriented with sensory details
- Social: Interpersonal with dialogue and emotional indicators
- Intellectual: Observational with deductive reasoning
