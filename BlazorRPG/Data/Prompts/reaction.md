# NARRATIVE REACTION
{PROMPT_CONTEXT}

## Player's Choice Execution
The player's choice represents their selected action. Execute this action and show the realistic consequences. The choice has been made and must now occur in the scene.

## ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS
- If "NPCs Present: None" then NO NPCs can appear or react
- If specific NPCs are listed, only those NPCs exist
- Never add elements not explicitly provided in the context
- Follow game state data exactly, never contradict it

## MANDATORY REALISM PRINCIPLES
- All reactions MUST be proportionate and realistic to the player's action
- Mundane actions receive mundane reactions
- NO magical, mystical, or unexplained reactions to ordinary actions
- Weather and environment should NOT dramatically change in response to player actions
- NPCs only notice or react if they would realistically do so and if they exist
- Maintain authentic medieval setting where everyday activities remain ordinary

## NARRATIVE CONTINUITY
- If introduction or previous narrative established character interest in specific elements, acknowledge this when player engages with them
- Show natural progression from observation to action
- Reference character's prior attention when relevant
- Build on established narrative momentum

## ESTABLISHED INTEREST ACKNOWLEDGMENT
When player chooses actions related to elements the character was observing:
- Acknowledge the prior attention
- Reference the established interest
- Show natural progression from observation to engagement
- Avoid treating engagement like completely new discovery

## ATTENTION CONSISTENCY
- Maintain focus established in previous narrative
- DO NOT have character's attention shift between multiple elements within same reaction
- Once interest is established, maintain that focus through narrative end
- Let the player choose whether to maintain, shift, or abandon established interests
- Avoid "attention wandering" that pre-decides character priorities

## REACTION EXECUTION
- Simple actions should have simple outcomes
- If player's action naturally completes their immediate goal, describe the completion
- Only introduce new elements if they would realistically occur and are allowed by game state
- NPCs should only act if they exist and have logical motivation
- Some reactions simply accomplish what the player intended
- Maintain continuity with previously established character focus

## PROGRESSION REQUIREMENTS
- Each reaction must advance the situation meaningfully
- Avoid repeating previous observations or descriptions
- Show concrete change from the player's action
- Move the narrative forward, not sideways
- If nothing significant happens, describe completion rather than prolonging
- End with a NEW situation, not a rehash of the previous one

## RESOLUTION CLARITY
- Show what the player's action actually accomplished
- Make clear what changed as a result
- Indicate what new opportunities or challenges emerged
- Some actions simply resolve without creating new complications

## Writing Requirements
Write in first-person present tense:
- Show the player's action and its ACTUAL results
- Describe what happens naturally as a consequence
- End with the resulting situation
- Keep to 2-3 paragraphs maximum

CRITICAL: Not every action needs drama or complications. Sometimes the player accomplishes their goal, or faces straightforward outcomes that require new decisions.
