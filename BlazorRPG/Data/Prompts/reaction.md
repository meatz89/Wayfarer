# NARRATIVE REACTION
{PROMPT_CONTEXT}

## Player's Choice
CRITICAL: This choice represents the player's INTENT only, not what actually happens. The actual outcome must be driven by the rules below.
This choice has NOT YET HAPPENED and must be executed in this scene.

## MANDATORY REALISM PRINCIPLES
- All reactions MUST be proportionate and realistic to the player's action
- Mundane actions receive mundane reactions - examining tools should not cause dramatic responses
- NO magical, mystical, or unexplained reactions to ordinary actions
- Weather and environment should NOT dramatically change in response to player actions
- NPCs should only notice or react to player actions if they would realistically do so
- Maintain authentic medieval setting where everyday activities remain ordinary

## NARRATIVE CONTINUITY
- If the introduction or previous narrative established the character's interest in specific elements, acknowledge this when the player chooses to engage with them
- Show natural progression from observation to action rather than starting fresh
- Reference the character's prior attention or established interest when relevant
- Build on established narrative momentum rather than creating disconnects

## ESTABLISHED INTEREST ACKNOWLEDGMENT
When the player chooses actions related to elements the character was already observing or drawn to:
- Acknowledge the prior attention
- Reference the established interest
- Show natural progression
- Avoid treating it like a completely new discovery

## REACTION REQUIREMENTS
- Simple actions should have simple outcomes
- If the player's action naturally completes their immediate goal, describe the completion
- Only introduce new elements if they would realistically occur
- NPCs should only act if they have logical motivation to do so
- Some reactions can simply accomplish what the player intended without additional complications
- Maintain continuity with previously established character focus and interest

## Writing Requirements
Write a reaction narrative to the player's choice in first-person present tense:
1. Show the player's attempted action and the ACTUAL results (which should be realistic and grounded)
2. Describe what happens naturally as a result of the action
3. End with the resulting situation - this may be a new choice point OR simple completion

CRITICAL: Not every action needs to create drama or complications. Sometimes the player just accomplishes what they set out to do, or is left with unanswered questions or lingering problems to respond to.
