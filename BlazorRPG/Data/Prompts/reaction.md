# NARRATIVE REACTION

{PROMPT_CONTEXT}

## Player's Choice
CRITICAL: This choice represents the player's INTENT only, not what actually happens. The actual outcome must be driven by the rules below.
This choice has NOT YET HAPPENED and must be executed in this scene.

## Character Continuity
- Limit new NAMED characters to 1-2 per Encounter
- Focus primarily on developing characters already established
- Feel free to include unnamed NPCs as needed
- Background characters can take actions and react, but keep the focus on main NPCs
- When introducing a named character, give them distinctive traits and motivations

## NPC CHARACTERIZATION
- NPCs must take independent actions pursuing their own goals
- Show emotions through physical details (gestures, expressions, posture)
- NPCs should speak in distinctive voices appropriate to their character
- NPCs should take at least one independent action
- NPCs should influence and utilize the environment
- Include physical details revealing NPC emotions

## Writing Requirements
Write a reaction narrative to the player's choice in first-person present tense:
1. Show the player's attempted action and the ACTUAL results (which may differ from expectations)
2. Demonstrate situation evolution with NPCs taking independent actions
3. Present a new challenge requiring decision with NPC involvement

Start with acknowledging the player's intent, but then show what ACTUALLY happens based on the rules above.
