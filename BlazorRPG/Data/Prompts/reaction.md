## Player Character Status
{PLAYER_STATUS}

## Player's Choice
'{SELECTED_CHOICE}' (Player Intent: '{CHOICE_DESCRIPTION}')
CRITICAL: This choice represents the player's INTENT only, not what actually happens. The actual outcome must be driven by the mechanical changes below.
This choice has NOT YET HAPPENED and must be executed in this scene.

## Mechanical Changes (Must Be Reflected In Narrative)
- Momentum Change: {OLD_MOMENTUM} → {NEW_MOMENTUM}
- Pressure Change: {OLD_PRESSURE} → {NEW_PRESSURE}
- Health Change: {OLD_HEALTH} → {NEW_HEALTH}/{MAX_HEALTH}
- Confidence Change: {OLD_CONFIDENCE} → {NEW_CONFIDENCE}/{MAX_CONFIDENCE}
- Concentration Change: {OLD_CONCENTRATION} → {NEW_CONCENTRATION}/{MAX_CONCENTRATION}
- Approach Changes: {APPROACH_CHANGES} | Focus Changes: {FOCUS_CHANGES}
- New Tags: {NEW_TAGS_ACTIVATED}
- Strategic Effects: {STRATEGIC_EFFECTS}

## Character Continuity
- Limit new NAMED characters to 1-2 per encounter (not per turn)
- Focus primarily on developing characters already established in previous turns
- Feel free to include unnamed NPCs as needed
- Background characters can take actions and react, but keep the focus on main NPCs
- When introducing a named character, give them distinctive traits and motivations

## NPC CHARACTERIZATION
- NPCs must take independent actions pursuing their own goals
- Show emotions through physical details (gestures, expressions, posture)
- NPCs should speak in distinctive voices appropriate to their character
- Every turn, NPCs must take at least one independent action
- NPCs should influence and utilize the environment
- Include physical details revealing NPC emotions

## Writing Requirements
Write three paragraphs in first-person present tense:
1. Show the player's attempted action and the ACTUAL results (which may differ from expectations)
2. Demonstrate situation evolution with NPCs taking independent actions
3. Present a new challenge requiring decision with NPC involvement

## Narrative Implementation of Mechanical Changes:
- Show approach/focus combination in player's actions
- Demonstrate momentum/pressure/resource changes narratively
- MOMENTUM CHANGES must be shown as progress (or setbacks) toward the character's goal
- PRESSURE CHANGES must be reflected as situational escalation or de-escalation
- RESOURCE CHANGES (Health/Confidence/Concentration) are CRITICALLY IMPORTANT and must be shown as actual injuries or impacts to the character
- APPROACH CHANGES must be reflected in how the environment and NPCs react to the player
- NEW TAGS must manifest as situational constraints or new opportunities
- STRATEGIC EFFECTS must be shown as contextual advantages or disadvantages
- If using a NATURAL approach for this archetype: Show confidence, skill, and ease
- If using a DANGEROUS approach for this archetype: Show struggle, discomfort, or inexperience

Start with acknowledging the player's intent, but then show what ACTUALLY happens based on the mechanical outcomes.
