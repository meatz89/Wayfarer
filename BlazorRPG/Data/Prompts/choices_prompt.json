How did you manage through those hard months?\"\n\nChoice 2: I analyze the ledger discrepancies - I trace my finger across the columns of numbers, comparing the winter grain stores against the reported tax payments. The pattern of shortfalls suggests deliberate undercounting.\n\nChoice 3: I test the ice carefully - I kneel at the pond's edge and press my weight gradually onto the frozen surface, listening for cracking sounds while watching for subtle movements that might indicate weakness.\n\nChoice 4: I stand my ground firmly - I plant my feet shoulder-width apart and meet the merchant's angry gaze without flinching. \"The price we agreed upon is fair, and I expect you to honor it.\"\n\nEach choice should reflect its approach ({CHOICE_STYLE_GUIDANCE}) and maintain continuity with the previous narrative."
