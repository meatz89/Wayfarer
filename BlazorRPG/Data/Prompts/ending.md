1. PROVIDES A CLEAR RESOLUTION based on the {ENCOUNTER_OUTCOME} result:
   - FAILURE: Show how the character must accept defeat, retreat, or compromise severely
   - PARTIAL: Depict a mixed outcome with some success but clear limitations or drawbacks
   - STANDARD: Show a solid success that achieves the main objective satisfactorily
   - EXCEPTIONAL: Portray an outstanding success that exceeds expectations

2. SHOWS THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCES of the character's approach emphasis:
   - Dominance: Show how forceful methods affected relationships and reputation
   - Rapport: Reflect how social connections were enhanced or strained
   - Analysis: Demonstrate how understanding patterns led to insights or overthinking
   - Precision: Show how careful execution created control or rigidity
   - Concealment: Reveal how hidden methods created advantages or suspicion

3. MAINTAINS THE SAME REALISTIC TONE established throughout the encounter:
   - Use concrete, observable details instead of abstract concepts
   - Show consequences through specific physical and social details
   - Keep language simple and period-appropriate
   - Focus on immediate personal outcomes, not broad impacts
   - Include sensory details that ground the conclusion

4. PROVIDES A SENSE OF CLOSURE while hinting at future implications:
   - Resolve the immediate situation completely
   - Show how this outcome affects the character's immediate future
   - Suggest small, realistic consequences that might follow
   - Maintain the modest, survival-focused tone of everyday medieval life
