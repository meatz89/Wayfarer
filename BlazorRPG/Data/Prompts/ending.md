## ENCOUNTER OUTCOME GUIDANCE

Write 3-4 paragraphs of grounded, first-person narrative that:

1. BEGINS BY DIRECTLY ADDRESSING GOAL ACHIEVEMENT:
   - The first paragraph MUST explicitly state whether the goal to {CHARACTER_GOAL} was achieved
   - FAILURE: Failing the encounter is NOT the end of the world. The player may have failed to reach his goal for now, but may have opened up new narrative opportunities or alternatives ways.
   - PARTIAL: Show how the character partially achieved the goal with limitations
   - STANDARD: Demonstrate full achievement of the goal as intended
   - EXCEPTIONAL: Show how the character not only achieved his goal but gained additional benefits

2. SHOWS THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCES of the character's approach emphasis:
   - Dominance: Show how forceful methods affected goal achievement and relationships
   - Rapport: Reflect how social connections helped or hindered reaching the goal
   - Analysis: Demonstrate how understanding patterns contributed to goal success or failure
   - Precision: Show how careful execution impacted the outcome related to the goal
   - Evasion: Reveal how evasive methods affected goal achievement

3. PROVIDES CONCRETE DETAILS about what the character gained or lost:
   - For resource-based goals: Specify exactly what was obtained or forfeited
   - For social goals: Show exactly how relationships changed
   - For information goals: Detail what knowledge was gained or missed
   - Use specific quantities, descriptions, and tangible outcomes
   - Avoid vague results - be specific about the goal outcome

4. CONCLUDES with immediate future implications:
   - Show the next 1-2 immediate steps the character will take following this outcome
   - Keep these steps directly connected to having achieved/failed the goal
   - Maintain the modest, survival-focused tone of everyday medieval life

- NO MIND-READING: Show NPC reactions through observable behaviors only
- MUNDANE LANGUAGE: Write as an ordinary person would describe events
- NO DRAMATIC LEAPS: All outcomes flow naturally from established context
- FIRST PERSON, PRESENT TENSE: "I count my remaining coins..." not "I counted..."
- CONCRETE DETAILS: Use specific sensory information, not abstract concepts

## SUMMARY

Remember:
- Your output will be given directly to the player. Do NOT acknowledge these instructions in your response
- Write naturally in the authentic voice of an ordinary medieval traveler concluding an everyday challenge.
