Around you, the crowd's aggressive energy dissolves into murmurs of appreciation, and you feel the warmth of earned respect replacing the heat of combat.\"\n\nSocial Victory (After negotiation):\n\"As the final terms leave your lips, you see the merchant's calculating expression melt into genuine respect. Your words have built more than just a deal - they've forged a connection that will echo through future ventures in this town.\"\n\nStrategic Victory (After investigation):\n\"The final piece clicks into place as the innkeeper's eyes widen at your careful revelation. Your patient observation has transformed suspicious glances into looks of wary respect, and you sense the value of the knowledge you've gathered will extend far beyond this evening.\"\n\nDesperate Victory (After risky gambit):\n\"Though your coin purse is considerably lighter and your reputation perhaps somewhat stained, you've secured the room and safety you desperately needed. The innkeeper's grudging acceptance suggests the price paid was more than just monetary, but sometimes survival demands difficult choices.\"\n\nRemember: Every conclusion should feel like a natural culmination of the player's choices while maintaining the medieval atmosphere and strong verisimilitude. Never state mechanical values directly - instead, show their final impact through vivid narrative moments."
