# 1. Vision and Design Pillars

## Why This Document Exists

This document defines WHAT Wayfarer is and WHY it works. Every design decision flows from these pillars. When evaluating a feature, mechanic, or content piece, ask: "Does this reinforce our pillars, or undermine them?"

## 1.1 Core Experience Statement

**Wayfarer creates strategic depth through impossible choices, not mechanical complexity.**

Every decision forces the player to choose between multiple suboptimal paths, revealing character through constraint. The game is not about winning—it's about deciding what you're willing to sacrifice to achieve what matters most.

### The Essential Experience

You are a traveler in a low-fantasy world managing scarce resources across an unforgiving landscape. You accept delivery jobs to earn coins, navigate dangerous routes where every encounter demands difficult choices, and return barely able to afford food and shelter.

The core feeling: **"I can afford A OR B, but not both."**

This is not a puzzle. There is no correct answer. Your character emerges from what you sacrifice along the way.

## 1.2 Player Fantasy

### You Are: A Low-Fantasy Traveler

Not a hero. Not chosen. Not destined. You survive through:
- **Optimization skill** — Learning routes, spotting opportunities, managing resources efficiently
- **Social intelligence** — Building relationships that provide advantages
- **Strategic planning** — Deciding what to pursue and what to sacrifice
- **Tactical execution** — Succeeding in card-based challenges when necessary

### The World: Grounded Historical-Fantasy

Low-magic setting where danger comes from terrain, weather, bandits, and human nature. Magic exists but is rare and never your primary tool. All systems mirror real-world dynamics—relationships deplete when used, resources are genuinely scarce, the world doesn't care about your success.

### The Journey: Infinite and Personal

No ending. The road goes on forever. Your story emerges through resource priorities, relationship patterns, build specialization, and moments where you reveal character through constraint.

## 1.3 Design Pillars Explained

### Pillar 1: Impossible Choices

**Why:** Strategic depth without mechanical complexity. When resources are scarce and all options have genuine costs, decision-making becomes the game—not memorizing combos or grinding stats.

**How it manifests:**
- Orthogonal resource costs (time vs coins vs energy vs relationships)
- Four-choice archetype ensuring multiple valid approaches
- Tight economic margins forcing continuous prioritization
- Specialization creating capability AND vulnerability

### Pillar 2: Perfect Information

**Why:** Strategy requires predictability. Hidden gotchas create frustration, not depth. When players can calculate costs and plan approaches, skill expression becomes meaningful.

**How it manifests:**
- All costs, requirements, and rewards visible before selection
- Challenge outcomes predictable from player stats and card quality
- No random "you lose" events without player agency
- Strategic layer shows everything; tactical layer tests execution

### Pillar 3: Infinite Journey (Frieren Principle)

**Why:** Eliminates the hardest design problem—satisfying endings. Removes pressure to rush. Creates permission to engage at your own pace. The A-story waits.

**How it manifests:**
- Main narrative never resolves—you travel, arrive, meet people, move on
- Procedural content generation for infinite A-story continuation
- No "post-game awkwardness" of having saved the world but still collecting herbs
- Player chooses when to stop, not the game

### Pillar 4: Earned Scarcity

**Why:** Tight margins create tension. When delivery earnings barely cover survival, every efficiency gain feels earned. Mastery means optimization, not power accumulation.

**How it manifests:**
- Delivery profits deliberately minimal
- Rest, healing, and services consume significant resources
- Equipment provides incremental advantages, not transformative power
- Late-game challenges remain genuinely challenging

### Pillar 5: Character Through Constraint

**Why:** Identity emerges from sacrifice, not accumulation. Limited stat points force specialization. Helping one person means disappointing another. Your build reflects your values.

**How it manifests:**
- Cannot maximize all stats—must choose specialization
- Relationship investment creates obligations
- Time spent on side content is time not spent on main story
- Choices close doors permanently (and this is not failure)

## 1.4 Anti-Goals: What Wayfarer Is NOT

### Not a Power Fantasy
No exponential growth. Stats improve slowly. Equipment provides incremental advantages. You never become unstoppable. Resource scarcity persists throughout.

### Not a Hero's Journey
You don't save the world. You don't defeat the dark lord. You travel, work, survive, build relationships, and continue traveling. The journey is the point.

### Not a Puzzle With Correct Answers
Multiple valid paths exist. Choosing one means sacrificing another. Optimization is possible but "optimal" depends on what you value.

### Not Artificial Urgency
No ticking clocks forcing rushed decisions. Time pressure comes from opportunity cost (doing X means not doing Y), never arbitrary deadlines.

### Not Guilt Manipulation
The game never punishes you for not engaging with content. NPCs don't die because you ignored them. The world persists, patient.

## 1.5 Emotional Aesthetic Goals

**Primary: Contemplation Through Constraint**
Choices are not timed. You can pause, consider, calculate. Pressure comes from scarcity, not urgency.

**Secondary: Meaningful Consequence**
Every choice has weight. Resources spent are genuinely spent. You live with your decisions.

**Tertiary: Journey Over Destination**
Success is measured by journey quality, not arrival. The game teaches letting go of perfectionism—you cannot have everything.
