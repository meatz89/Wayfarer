# 3. Core Gameplay Loop

## Why This Document Exists

This document defines WHAT players do moment-to-moment and WHY the three-tier loop structure creates strategic depth. Understanding the loops explains how impossible choices manifest at every temporal scale.

## 3.1 Three-Tier Loop Hierarchy

Wayfarer operates on three distinct temporal scales, each serving different player needs:

| Loop | Duration | Purpose | Challenge Type |
|------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **SHORT** | 10-30 seconds | Immediate feedback, tactical rhythm | Resource trade-offs |
| **MEDIUM** | 5-15 minutes | Session structure, economic cycle | Resource management |
| **LONG** | Hours | Character identity, strategic investment | Build specialization |

### Why Three Tiers?

**Immediate feedback (SHORT):** Constant confirmation that actions matter. Resources change visibly. Progress advances measurably.

**Session structure (MEDIUM):** Natural stopping points. Start delivery → complete delivery → satisfying pause. Progress feels complete even in short play sessions.

**Long-term motivation (LONG):** Meta-progression goals. Character builds emerge. Relationships develop. World understanding deepens.

## 3.2 SHORT Loop: Encounter-Choice-Consequence

**Duration:** 10-30 seconds
**Structure:** Encounter → Evaluate Options → Choose → See Consequence → Progress

### The Rhythm

1. **Encounter situation** with visible context
2. **Evaluate 4 choices** with all costs/requirements shown
3. **Select one path** based on resources and priorities
4. **Experience consequence** (resource change, progress)
5. **Advance** to next encounter or destination

### Example: Muddy Road Encounter

*"The path ahead has become a muddy quagmire from recent rains."*

| Choice | Cost | Analysis |
|--------|------|----------|
| Push through with determination | 3 energy, 1 time | High energy, reliable |
| Find detour around mud | 1 energy, 2 time | Saves energy, costs time |
| Hire local guide | 5 coins, 1 time | Monetary cost, efficient |
| Athletic leap (Physical check) | Stat requirement | Risk/reward, stat-gated |

**No correct answer.** Energy-rich players push through. Time-rich players detour. Coin-rich players hire help. Physical specialists take the challenge. Each valid for different builds.

## 3.3 MEDIUM Loop: Delivery Cycle

**Duration:** 5-15 minutes
**Structure:** Accept Job → Travel Route → Handle Encounters → Deliver → Collect Payment

### The Cycle

1. **Accept delivery job** (known destination, payment, time limit)
2. **Plan route** (shorter but harder vs longer but safer)
3. **Travel segments** encountering SHORT loop situations
4. **Arrive at destination** and complete delivery
5. **Receive payment** and assess profit/loss

### Why Delivery Works

- **Clear goal structure** — Know exactly what success looks like
- **Calculable economics** — Can estimate profit before accepting
- **Route choice matters** — Risk/reward trade-offs in path selection
- **Natural session boundary** — Complete delivery = satisfying stopping point

### Economic Reality

Delivery earnings barely cover travel costs. Profit margins are deliberately tight:
- Gross payment: ~20-30 coins per delivery
- Route costs (food, rest, tolls): ~15-25 coins
- Net profit: ~5-10 coins if efficient

**This is intentional.** Tight margins make efficiency matter. Every coin saved is meaningful.

## 3.4 LONG Loop: Character Development

**Duration:** Hours across sessions
**Structure:** Earn → Invest → Specialize → Discover → Repeat

### The Arc

1. **Earn resources** through delivery cycles
2. **Invest in growth** (stats, equipment, relationships)
3. **Specialize your build** (cannot maximize everything)
4. **Discover content** (A-story progression, side stories, world exploration)
5. **Repeat** with evolved capabilities and new opportunities

### Build Identity Emerges

Limited stat points force specialization:
- **Investigator build** (Insight 4, Cunning 3): Dominates Mental challenges, weak in Social
- **Diplomat build** (Rapport 4, Diplomacy 3): Dominates Social, weak in Physical
- **Generalist build** (all stats 2-3): Handles everything moderately, dominates nothing

Your build reflects your values and playstyle. This IS character development.

## 3.5 Strategic vs Tactical Layers

### The Separation

**Strategic Layer (WHAT and WHERE):**
- Flow: Scene → Situation → Choice
- Information: Perfect (all costs visible)
- Decision: WHETHER to attempt

**Tactical Layer (HOW):**
- Flow: Challenge Session → Card Play → Victory/Failure
- Information: Hidden complexity (draw order, exact flow)
- Execution: HOW to succeed

### The Bridge

Choices spawn challenges when player opts into tactical layer:
- **Instant actions** stay in strategic layer (apply costs immediately)
- **Challenge actions** cross to tactical layer (Mental/Physical/Social card game)

**Why this works:** Player plans strategically (I can afford this), then executes tactically (I play cards well). Strategic choice remains meaningful—bad plan = tactical struggle.
