# Endless Story Design - Quick Reference

**Purpose:** One-page overview for session continuity. Details live in referenced documents.

## The Core Insight

A-Story creates B-Stories (success rewards) and C-Stories (journey texture). They are causally linked, not independent systems.

```
A-Story (Building → Checking)
    ├── SUCCESS → B-Story (reward thread, same characters/locations)
    └── JOURNEY → C-Story (natural emergence from travel)
```

## Key Principles (Summary)

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Building → Checking** | A-stories alternate stat growth and stat tests (Sir Brante rhythm) |
| **B = Earned Reward** | B-stories spawn when player succeeds at hard A-story checks |
| **C = Natural Texture** | C-stories emerge from journey—not spawned, experienced |
| **Narrative Continuity** | B-stories continue A-story threads with same characters/locations |
| **Travel Cost Gate** | Distance creates resource demand; B-story rewards fund travel |
| **Terrain Variety** | Route choice = impossible choice (time vs stamina vs coins vs encounters) |

## Open Questions

- B-story spawn mechanics (A-story success → B-story creation technically)
- Narrative continuity (same characters/locations carrying forward)
- Terrain-aware C-story archetype selection
- Multiple route alternatives
