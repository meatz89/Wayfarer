# 6. Balance Philosophy

## Why This Document Exists

This document explains HOW balance creates strategic depth and WHY our principles differ from traditional RPG design. Balance in Wayfarer emerges from scarcity, not stat checks.

---

## 6.1 Core Balance Principle

**Challenge comes from resource scarcity, not mechanical difficulty.**

Traditional RPGs create difficulty through:
- Stat checks that block progress
- Enemies that deal more damage
- Skills that require higher levels

Wayfarer creates difficulty through:
- Orthogonal costs forcing prioritization
- Time scarcity preventing "do everything"

## 6.2 The Eight Balance Rules

### Rule 1: Perfect Information
All costs, requirements, and rewards visible before selection. No hidden gotchas. Players can calculate and plan.

### Rule 2: Resource Scarcity Creates Challenge
Difficulty comes from limited resources, not stat gates. Players with any build can progress—the question is COST.

### Rule 3: Orthogonal Costs Prevent Single Best Answer
When paths cost different resource types (time vs coins vs energy), no universal "optimal" exists.

### Rule 4: Specialization Creates Capability AND Vulnerability
High Insight opens Investigation paths but leaves Social paths expensive. Every strength implies weakness.

### Rule 5: No Unwinnable States
The four-choice archetype guarantees at least one path is ALWAYS available. Resource-strapped players pay more but progress.

### Rule 6: Mastery Through Optimization
Expert players complete content with fewer resources, not more power. Efficiency is the reward for skill.

### Rule 7: Tight Margins Throughout
Late-game margins remain tight. You never reach "resources don't matter" state. Optimization stays relevant.

### Rule 8: Build Diversity Is Mandatory
All stat distributions must have viable paths. If content only works for one build, content is broken.

## 6.3 The Four-Choice Balance Pattern (For Mixed Situations)

**Note:** This pattern applies to MIXED situations where trade-offs exist. Building situations offer all-positive choices. Crisis situations offer all-negative choices with stat-based severity. See §6.4 for situation types.

For Mixed situations, balance across four path types:

| Path | Requirement | Cost | Target Player |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| **Stat-Gated** | High threshold | Free | Specialists in that stat |
| **Resource** | None | Significant coins/items | Resource-rich players |
| **Challenge** | Moderate stat | Session entry + time | Skill-expressive players |
| **Fallback** | None | Time + social cost | Anyone (guaranteed) |

### Balance Verification (Mixed Situations)

✓ Specialists find their optimal path (stat-gated)
✓ Generalists have viable alternatives (resource/fallback)
✓ No single path dominates all situations
✓ Fallback always exists (no soft-locks)

### Building Situation Pattern

All choices positive, differentiated by WHAT you gain:

| Choice | Gains | Target Build |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Studious | +Insight | Investigators |
| Social | +Rapport | Diplomats |
| Assertive | +Authority | Enforcers |
| Restful | +Resources | Anyone |

### Crisis Situation Pattern

All choices negative, stats determine SEVERITY:

| Stat Level | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| Exceeds threshold | Minor loss (damage mitigated) |
| Meets threshold | Moderate loss (expected) |
| Below threshold | Major loss (punished for underinvestment) |

OR-type requirements let multiple stats qualify for damage mitigation.

## 6.4 The Sir Brante Rhythm (Reference Model)

Wayfarer's progression draws from "The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante" - a game where every stat point matters immediately, creating a satisfying rhythm of building and testing capabilities.

### The Core Tension

Two resource systems create competing pressures:

| Resource | Nature | Spent By | Gained By |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Permanent Stats** | Accumulate over time | Never lost (rarely decreased) | Stat-building choices |
| **Resolve** | Fluctuating pool | Unlocking hard choices | Passive/safe decisions |

**The Dilemma:** Spend resolve NOW to unlock stat-building choices (invest in future), or save resolve for future crises (preserve options). This tension is NEVER fully resolved - it IS the game.

### Situation Types (NOT Uniform Structure)

Situations are NOT all the same. Three distinct types exist:

| Type | Choice Outcomes | Player Experience | Example |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Building** | ALL positive (different flavors) | Accumulating progress | Peaceful inn evening - study, socialize, plan, or rest |
| **Crisis** | ALL negative (varying severity) | Minimizing damage | Bandit ambush - fight, flee, bribe, or surrender |
| **Mixed** | Trade-offs | Strategic decisions | Negotiation - each path gains something, loses something |

**Building Situations:** Every choice leads to GAINS. The decision is WHAT to gain:
- "Study" → +1 Insight
- "Socialize" → +1 Rapport
- "Plan" → +1 Cunning
- "Rest" → Full recovery

No wrong answers. Player invests in their preferred direction.

**Crisis Situations:** Every choice leads to LOSSES. Stats determine severity:
- High Authority → Minor loss ("You intimidate them, lose only 2 coins")
- Low Authority → Major loss ("They take everything, lose 10 coins and -1 reputation")

The player is being TESTED. Prior stat investment pays off.

**Mixed Situations:** Trade-off territory where gains and losses coexist.

### The Pacing Rhythm (Must Be Tracked)

The game must TRACK where the player is in the rhythm:

| Phase | What Happens | Procedural Decision |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Accumulation** | 2-4 building situations | Grant opportunities to grow |
| **Test** | 1 crisis situation | Challenge based on expected stats |
| **Recovery** | 1-2 building situations | Restore after crisis |
| **Repeat** | Cycle continues | Escalate thresholds each cycle |

**Procedural Context Questions:**
- How many building situations since last crisis?
- Is player stat accumulation near expected threshold?
- Did player just survive a crisis? (recovery needed)
- Is this an appropriate moment to test?

**Anti-Patterns:**
- Crisis → Crisis → Crisis = Unfair, no accumulation time
- Building → Building → Building forever = No tension, no testing
- Crisis when player is far below expected stats = Punishment without fairness

**The Feeling:** Player senses the rhythm. "I've been gaining stats... something bad is coming." The anticipation creates tension even in peaceful moments.

### OR-Type Requirements (Multiple Valid Paths)

Major choices offer multiple qualification paths:

| Path Type | Example | Player Served |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **High Stat** | Authority ≥ 5 | Specialists who invested |
| **Stat Combination** | Cunning ≥ 3 AND ally relationship | Networkers |
| **Resolve Flex** | Authority ≥ 3 AND spend resolve | Almost-qualified, burn reserve |
| **Resource Alternative** | Pay 10 coins | Resource-rich players |
| **Fallback** | Accept poor outcome | Anyone (guaranteed) |

**Design Principle:** Everyone can progress, but not in the same way. Different builds experience different optimal paths through the same content.

### Trade-Off Consequences

Every significant choice involves SIMULTANEOUS gains and losses:

| Choice Pattern | Example | Creates |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Stat vs Stat** | +1 Authority, -1 Rapport | Specialization pressure |
| **Stat vs Resource** | +1 Insight, -5 Coins | Investment decision |
| **Stat vs Relationship** | +1 Cunning, NPC disapproves | Social consequences |
| **Resource vs Time** | -10 Coins OR wait 2 days | Urgency trade-off |

**Philosophy:** The game refuses to give "all wins." Prioritization IS the gameplay.

### Every Point Matters (Tight Margins)

Stat thresholds are calibrated so players are ALWAYS near the edge:

| Tier | Expected Primary Stat | Typical Threshold | Margin |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 0 (Tutorial) | 1-2 | 2-3 | ±1 point decides |
| 1 (Early) | 3-4 | 4-5 | ±1 point decides |
| 2 (Mid) | 5-6 | 6-7 | ±1 point decides |
| 3 (Late) | 7-8 | 8-9 | ±1 point decides |

**The Feeling:** A single stat point gained three situations ago determines whether you qualify for the free path NOW. Choices compound. Nothing is wasted.

### Categorical Scaling Preserves Rhythm

The SAME rhythm operates at every tier - categorical properties scale VALUES, not STRUCTURE:

| What Scales | How It Scales |
|-------------|---------------|
| Stat thresholds | Tier base + NPC demeanor adjustment |
| Resource costs | Tier base + quality adjustment |
| Stat rewards | Tier base (higher tiers grant more per choice) |
| Trade-off severity | Tier scales both gains AND losses |

**Critical:** Tutorial at Tier 0 and late-game at Tier 3 feel equally tight because margins scale proportionally. The rhythm is preserved; only the numbers change.

---

## 6.5 Difficulty Scaling Mechanisms

### Categorical Properties, Not Level Gates

Difficulty scales through entity properties:
- **NPC Demeanor:** Friendly → Neutral → Suspicious → Hostile
- **Environment Quality:** Poor → Standard → Fine → Exceptional
- **Power Dynamic:** Subordinate → Equal → Superior → Authority

These adjust base archetype costs, creating contextual difficulty without explicit "level 5 required" gates.

### Progression Tier Expectations

As A-story advances, expected player state increases:

| Tier | A-Story | Expected Stats | Economic State |
|------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Tutorial | A1-A3 | 1-2 in primary | Tight margins |
| Early | A4-A6 | 2-3 in primary | Moderate surplus |
| Mid | A7-A12 | 3-4 in primary | Strategic reserves |
| Late | A13+ | 4-5 in primary | Optimized efficiency |

**Key:** Margins remain tight at every tier. Late-game players face scaled challenges, not trivial content.

## 6.6 Build Diversity

### Why All Builds Must Work

If only one stat distribution succeeds, the game becomes a puzzle with a correct answer. We want:
- Multiple valid approaches to every situation
- Different builds experiencing different optimal paths
- No "trap builds" that fail content

### How We Ensure Diversity

1. **Four-choice archetype:** Every situation has paths for different specializations
2. **Stat-agnostic fallbacks:** Resource and time paths require no stats
3. **Challenge variety:** Mental, Physical, Social each favor different stats
4. **Orthogonal costs:** Different builds "pay" in different currencies

### Build Archetypes

| Build | Primary Stats | Excels At | Pays Extra For |
|-------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Investigator | Insight, Cunning | Mental challenges | Social situations |
| Diplomat | Rapport, Diplomacy | Social challenges | Physical obstacles |
| Enforcer | Authority | Intimidation, combat | Subtle investigation |
| Generalist | Balanced | Flexibility | Never gets free paths |

---

## 6.7 Balance Anti-Patterns

### Avoid: Single Resource Dominance
If everything costs coins, coin-rich players trivialize content. Ensure orthogonal costs.

### Avoid: Stat Gate Without Alternative
If only Insight 5+ can progress, Investigators proceed free while others are stuck. Ensure fallbacks.

### Avoid: Hidden Failure States
If choosing "wrong" option leads to unrecoverable loss, players feel cheated. Make consequences visible.

### Avoid: Power Creep
If late-game equipment trivializes challenges, tight margins philosophy breaks. Keep incremental advantages small.
