# Wayfarer: One-Pager

## Elevator Pitch

A low-fantasy tactical RPG where strategic depth emerges from impossible choices, not mechanical complexity. You are a traveling courier navigating a harsh world where every decision forces sacrifice—resources are scarce, margins are razor-thin, and your character emerges not from what you achieve, but from what you're willing to give up.

## Core Experience

**"I can afford to do A OR B, but not both. Both paths are valid. Both have genuine costs. Which cost will I accept?"**

This is not a puzzle with a correct answer. It's life management through continuous triage.

## Design Pillars

| Pillar | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Impossible Choices** | Every decision forces trade-offs between valid alternatives. No optimal path exists—only the path you choose to walk. |
| **Perfect Information** | All costs, requirements, and rewards visible before selection. Strategy emerges from resource management, not hidden gotchas. |
| **Infinite Journey** | The game never ends. The A-story continues forever. Success is measured by the journey, not arrival at a destination. |
| **Earned Scarcity** | Delivery earnings barely cover survival. Profit margins are deliberately tight. Mastery means efficiency, not power. |
| **Character Through Constraint** | Your identity emerges from what you sacrifice. Helping one person means disappointing another. Specialization creates vulnerability. |

## What This Game Is NOT

Not a power fantasy. Not a hero's journey. Not a puzzle with correct answers. No exponential growth, no becoming unstoppable, no artificial urgency, no guilt manipulation for ignoring content.

## Target Audience

Players who enjoy contemplative decision-making, resource optimization, and emergent narrative through constraint. Fans of Pentiment's historical grounding, Slay the Spire's tactical depth, and visual novels' narrative focus.

## Unique Selling Points

1. **Three parallel tactical systems** (Mental/Physical/Social) with distinct card mechanics
2. **Procedurally infinite main story** that never resolves—the journey IS the destination
3. **Four-choice archetype** ensuring every situation offers stat-gated, resource, challenge, and fallback paths
4. **Categorical content scaling** enabling AI-generated balanced content without global game state knowledge
