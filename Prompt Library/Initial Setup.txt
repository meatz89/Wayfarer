# ENCOUNTER INITIAL SETUP

Create a BRIEF, GROUNDED encounter framework for a [ENCOUNTER_TYPE] encounter at a [LOCATION_TYPE] with:

1. SETTING DETAILS:
   - One specific medieval location with REALISTIC, HARSH conditions
   - Maximum 3-4 sentences total on setting
   - Include 1-2 practical sensory details 
   - AVOID romanticized descriptions ("charming," "nestled," "cozy")

2. CHARACTER FRAMEWORK:
   - One NPC: [NPC_ROLE] who is [NPC_TRAIT] and [NPC_TRAIT]
   - Describe npc in maximum 2 sentences if included
   - NPC should be SUSPICIOUS or NEUTRAL by default, not kind or welcoming
   - For INTELLECTUAL or PHYSICAL encounters: Focus primarily on the ENVIRONMENT, not social interaction
   - For SOCIAL encounters: Focus primarily on the CHARACTER, not the environment

3. ENCOUNTER GOAL:
   - Determine the encounter goal from the encounter type, and location and npc present
   - State this plainly in 1-2 sentences maximum

4. STARTING CONDITIONS:
   - Initial approach tag emphasis: [PRIMARY_APPROACH_TAG], [SECONDARY_APPROACH_TAG]
   - Initial focus tag emphasis: [PRIMARY_FOCUS_TAG], [SECONDARY_FOCUS_TAG]
   - Initial momentum/pressure: 0/0

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:
1. A BRIEF title (3-5 words)
2. ONE paragraph (3-4 sentences) introducing the situation
3. ONE sentence stating your goal
4. ONE sentence about the NPC's disposition (or key environmental feature for INTELLECTUAL or PHYSICAL)
5. ONE sentence about a relevant environmental factor

IMPORTANT:
- Use PRESENT TENSE ONLY
- Focus on BASIC SURVIVAL NEEDS or CHALLENGES, not comfort
- Use PLAIN LANGUAGE appropriate to a common traveler
- Portray medieval life as DIFFICULT and HARSH
- Keep total response under 150 words
- For PHYSICAL encounters: Emphasize bodily sensations and physical effort, prefer action-oriented language
- For INTELLECTUAL encounters: Focus on observations and mental challenges, prefer inner monologues and environment observations
- For SOCIAL encounters: Focus on interaction dynamics and social pressure, prefer direct speech and npc descriptions
