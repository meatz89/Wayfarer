2. CHARACTER FRAMEWORK:
   - One NPC: [NPC_ROLE] who is [NPC_TRAIT]
   - Describe in maximum 2 sentences
   - NPC should be SUSPICIOUS or NEUTRAL by default, not kind or welcoming

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:

3. ONE sentence stating your goal
4. ONE sentence about the NPC's disposition (or key environmental feature for INTELLECTUAL)
5. ONE sentence about a relevant environmental factor

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on BASIC SURVIVAL needs, not comfort
- Use PLAIN LANGUAGE appropriate to a common traveler
- Portray medieval life as DIFFICULT and HARSH
- Keep total response under 150 words
- For PHYSICAL encounters: Emphasize bodily sensations and physical effort, prefer action-oriented language
- For INTELLECTUAL encounters: Focus on observations and mental challenges, prefer inner monologues and environment observations
- For SOCIAL encounters: Focus on interaction dynamics and social pressure, prefer direct speech and npc descriptions
