## Playthrough Log

### [0:00] Game Start
- Location: Common Room (The Brass Bell Inn)
- Resources: 8 coins, 4 health, 6/6 focus, 3/6 stamina, 0 hunger
- Stats: All at 0

### [0:01] Look Around
- Discovered scenes: "Secure Lodging" (Elena), "Secure Lodging" (Thomas)
- Action: Clicked first "Secure Lodging"

### [0:02] Secure Lodging - Situation 1
**Choices Available:**
1. ❌ Leverage your rapport (LOCKED - Rapport 3+, have 0)
2. ✅ Pay 5 coins for the service (SELECTED)
3. Attempt to negotiate better terms (Cost: -1 Resolve)
4. Politely decline (No cost)

**Decision:** Paid 5 coins to progress
**Reasoning:** Need to reach stat-granting choices
**Result:** Coins 8 → 3, scene completed

**⚠️ ISSUE:** Scene ended after situation 1. Never reached situation 2 with stat-granting choices (Chat warmly/Assert/Seek advantageous/Negotiate). Expected 3 situations in linear pattern per archetype.

### [0:03] Look Around Again
- New scene appeared: "Morning Reflection"
- Action: Clicked "Morning Reflection"

### [0:04] Morning Reflection Scene
**Choices Available:**
1. ❌ Take decisive action with expertise (LOCKED - Authority 4+ OR Insight 4+, have 0)
2. ❌ Pay for emergency solution (LOCKED - 25 coins, have 3)
3. ✅ Risk everything on a desperate gambit (SELECTED - Cost: -3 Resolve, 30 → 27)
4. Flee the situation (Cost: 2 time segments)

**Decision:** Chose "Risk everything" (only affordable option)
**Reasoning:** Other choices locked by stats (Authority/Insight 4+) or resources (25 coins)
**Result:** Scene completed, Resolve 30 → 27

**🎯 STAT GATING OBSERVED:** First encounter with stat requirements (Authority 4+ OR Insight 4+). This demonstrates opportunity cost - without building those stats early, premium choices are locked.

### [0:05] Look Around, Found Second "Secure Lodging"
- Action: Clicked second "Secure Lodging" (under Thomas NPC)

### [0:06] Secure Lodging - Stat-Granting Situation **CRITICAL FINDING**
**Choices Available (ALL LOCKED):**
1. ❌ Chat warmly with {NPCName} (LOCKED - 5 coins, have 3) → +1 Rapport
2. ❌ Assert your need for accommodation (LOCKED - 5 coins, have 3) → +1 Authority
3. ❌ Seek advantageous deal (LOCKED - 5 coins, have 3) → **+1 Cunning** ⚠️ WANTED
4. ❌ Negotiate a fair arrangement (LOCKED - 5 coins, have 3) → +1 Diplomacy

**🚨 SOFT-LOCK DISCOVERED:**
- Spent 5 coins in first scene (8 → 3 coins)
- ALL stat-granting choices cost 5 coins
- Cannot afford ANY choice to build stats
- No way to gain stats from this critical tutorial moment

**Design Issue:** Resource expenditure in early scenes prevents stat progression. Player must know NOT to spend coins before reaching stat-building opportunities.

**Decision:** Must restart game with different strategy - skip/decline first scene to preserve coins for stat building.
