## How to Run the Game

**Technology:** ASP.NET Core Blazor Server (verified: Program.cs contains `builder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor()`)

**Build Command:**
```bash
cd src
dotnet build
```

**Run Command:**
```bash
cd src
ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://localhost:<PORT>" dotnet run
```
- Use any port in **5000-5999** range
- **Avoid port 6000** - blocked by Chrome as "unsafe port"

**What Happens on Startup:**
1. GameWorld initialization via `GameWorldInitializer.CreateGameWorld()` (verified: Program.cs contains `GameWorld gameWorld = GameWorldInitializer.CreateGameWorld()`)
2. Content loading from JSON files in `Content/Core/` directory
3. Serilog console logging starts
4. Server listens on http://localhost:<PORT>
5. Navigate browser to http://localhost:<PORT>

**Prerequisites:**
- **.NET 8.0 SDK required** (verified: Wayfarer.csproj specifies `net8.0`)
- Browser: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge (latest version)
- Disk space: ~500MB for .NET SDK + game assets

**Automated vs Manual Testing:**
- **Automated tests** (Wayfarer.Tests.Project/) verify structural guarantees:
  - Tutorial spawning (TutorialInnLodgingIntegrationTest.cs)
  - Soft-lock prevention (FallbackPathTests.cs)
  - Economic structure (AStoryPlayerExperienceTest.cs)
  - **Architecture compliance** (97 tests verifying HIGHLANDER principles)
  - Run via: `cd Wayfarer.Tests.Project && dotnet test`
  - **Current status:** 436 tests passing (as of 2025-11-30)

- **Manual playtesting** (this guide) tests experiential qualities:
  - Does scarcity FEEL emergent over 2 hours?
  - Do builds create DISTINCT experiences?
  - Is strategic pressure meaningful?

**Run automated tests FIRST** to catch breaking issues, THEN manual playtest for experience validation.

**Architecture Test Categories (97 tests):**
| Category | What It Verifies |
|----------|------------------|
| Service Statelessness | Services contain logic, not state |
| Backend/Frontend Separation | Backend returns domain values, frontend handles CSS |
| Entity Identity Model | No IDs on domain entities (use object references) |
| HIGHLANDER Compliance | Single source of truth for all data |
| Type System Compliance | Proper use of List<T> vs Dictionary |

**Expected Console Output on Success:**
```
info: Content loading...
info: GameWorld initialized
info: Now listening on: http://localhost:<PORT>
```

**If Startup Fails:**

**GameWorld initialization error:**
```bash
# Check Content/Core/ exists and contains JSON files
ls -la src/Content/Core/*.json
# Should show 19 files (01_foundation.json through 22_tutorial_challenges.json)

# Run automated tests to isolate issue
cd Wayfarer.Tests.Project && dotnet test --filter "Tutorial"
```

**Port conflict (Address already in use):**
```bash
# Use a different port (any in 5000-5999 range)
ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://localhost:<DIFFERENT_PORT>" dotnet run
```

**Tutorial scene doesn't spawn:**
- Automated test verifies this (run `dotnet test --filter "Tutorial_LoadsSceneTemplates"`)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify GameWorld.IsGameStarted = true in debugger
- Check GameFacade.StartGameAsync() was called

**Reset game state:**
- Restart server (Ctrl+C, then rerun)
- Clear browser localStorage: F12 → Application → Local Storage → Clear
- Delete generated content: `rm -rf src/Content/Dynamic/*`

**Report bugs:**
- GitHub Issues: https://github.com/meatz89/Wayfarer/issues
- Include: Console logs, browser console errors, steps to reproduce
- Label: `playtest` for issues found during playtesting

## Debugging with Spawn Graph (`/spawngraph`)

**Purpose:** Visual debugging tool to inspect procedurally generated content - see which scenes spawned, which situations activated, which choices were made, and how entities are connected.

**Access:** Add `/spawngraph` to your game URL (e.g., if playing at `http://localhost:<PORT>`, navigate to `http://localhost:<PORT>/spawngraph`)

### What You Can See

**Node Types:**
- **Scenes** - Main story (A1, A2, A3...), Side stories, Service scenes
- **Situations** - Individual encounters within scenes
- **Choices** - Player decisions made (shows which path was taken)
- **Entities** - NPCs, Locations, Routes referenced by content

**Connection Types (Legend):**
- **Solid gray line** = Contains (hierarchy - scene contains situations)
- **Dashed green line** = Spawns scene (ScenesToSpawn reward fired)
- **Dashed blue line** = Spawns situation
- **Dotted orange line** = References location
- **Dotted red line** = References NPC
- **Dotted brown line** = References route

### Filtering Options

**By Type:** Toggle Scenes, Situations, Choices, Entities on/off

**By Category:**
- Main = A-story scenes (A1, A2, A3...)
- Side = Side quests
- Service = Utility scenes (job board, trading)

**By State:**
- Active = Currently in progress
- Completed = Finished
- Deferred = Created but waiting for activation conditions

### When to Use Spawn Graph

1. **Scene didn't activate?** Check if it's in Deferred state - may need correct location/NPC trigger
2. **Wrong scene cascade?** Trace the "Spawns scene" connections to see what triggered what
3. **Missing situation?** Look for situations that should be children of a scene
4. **Player choice tracking?** See exactly which choices were made and their consequences
5. **Entity dependencies?** Check which NPC/Location is assigned to which situation

### Quick Workflow

1. Play game, encounter issue
2. Navigate to `/spawngraph`
3. Use filters to focus on relevant content type
4. Search for specific scene/situation by name
5. Click node to see detail panel with full information
6. Double-click scene to zoom to its subtree
7. Click "Back to Game" to return

## What is Wayfarer?

**Genre:** Choice-picking narrative game like **The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante** with infinite journey structure like **Frieren: Beyond Journey's End**

**Core Experience:** Strategic depth through impossible choices, not mechanical complexity. (design/01_design_vision.md § Core Experience Statement)

**You are:** A traveler making difficult choices where your past decisions constrain current options. NOT a hero. You pick from available choices, invest in stats that unlock some paths while closing others, and live with cumulative consequences of specialization.

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION - Two Layers:**

### Tactical Layer (Individual Choices)
**What it is:** Each individual choice-picking moment you encounter

**How it feels:**
- Often has clear optimal path (not every choice is "hard")
- Some choices are all positive (pure rewards)
- Some choices are all negative (pick your poison)
- **You will NOT soft-lock from one bad choice**
- Perfect information lets you see exactly what you're getting

**NOT tested:** "Is this individual choice difficult enough?"

### Strategic Layer (Cumulative Consequences)
**What it is:** The pattern that emerges across 20+ choices over hours of play

**How it feels:**
- "I invested in Insight for 2 hours, NOW Social situations cost me dearly"
- "I spent coins on equipment, NOW I can't afford the NPC relationship"
- "I chose Route A ten times, NOW I'm specialized but vulnerable elsewhere"
- **The Essential Feeling:** "I can access path A OR path B based on my stats, not both. My past stat investments created this constraint."

**IS tested:** "Does resource scarcity emerge across hours? Do early choices constrain later options? Does specialization create distinct multi-hour experiences?"

---

## The Emotional Arc: What You Should FEEL Over Time

**This is THE MOST IMPORTANT section.** We're testing an EXPERIENCE, not mechanics.

### Hour 1 (Tutorial A1): "Who Do I Want to Be?"
**The Feeling:** Aspiration and exploration without pressure

**What happens:**
- NO stat requirements exist yet (all stats start at 0)
- Choices offer stat GRANTS: "Notice their weary expression, offer kind words" → +1 Rapport
- You pick based on PERSONALITY: "Am I empathetic? Analytical? Commanding?"
- Identity building through preference, not optimization
- Comfortable margins, no constraints

**Sir Brante parallel:** Pure identity formation - capability building without validation pressure

**What to test:** Do I feel FREE to explore different identity paths without fear?

---

### Hour 2 (Tutorial A2-A3): "I'm Becoming Someone"
**The Feeling:** First validation of chosen path, awareness of unchosen paths

**What happens:**
- FIRST stat gates appear - but as visible possibilities, not painful locks
- Gap display shows: "Need Insight 5 (you have 3) - need 2 more"
- Gates feel like FUTURE ASPIRATIONS: "That's what I could do if I keep growing this way"
- You've gained 2-4 stat points from A1 choices, identity forming
- Still 3+ viable paths available - gates don't block progression

**Sir Brante parallel:** "Seeing life you could have had" begins gently - locked paths are intriguing, not frustrating

**What to test:**
- Do I see locked choices and think "I want to work toward that"?
- Does it feel aspirational, not punishing?

**Regret emotion:** NOT YET - you haven't committed deeply enough

---

### Hour 3: "My Choices Define Me"
**The Feeling:** Validation of specialization, awareness of vulnerability

**What happens:**
- You CAN take some stat-gated paths (Rapport 3-4, you've built this)
- First REAL validation: "I unlocked this because of who I chose to become"
- But other gates remain locked (Authority 5, Cunning 4)
- Specialization consequences: "I focused on empathy, so commanding approaches are locked"
- You notice your BUILD creating distinct experience

**Sir Brante parallel:** Requirements feel like RECOGNITION ("you earned this") not GRIND

**What to test:**
- Do I feel POWERFUL in my specialized area?
- Do I notice I'm weaker in non-specialized areas?
- Does my identity feel distinct?

**Regret emotion:** BEGINS SUBTLY - "If I'd chosen Authority in A1, I could take that path now"

---

### Hour 4+: "I See the Life I Could Have Had"
**The Feeling:** Deep specialization creates power AND painful vulnerability. Visible regret.

**What happens:**
- Stat gates become FREQUENT (most situations have 2-3 gated paths)
- Clear specialization (Insight 7, Cunning 5 OR Rapport 7, Diplomacy 5)
- Vulnerability becomes PAINFUL: Low Authority (2) locks out entire conversation branches
- **THE CORE FEELING:** "I see this Authority 6 path that would solve everything elegantly, but I CAN'T take it because I chose to be an Investigator"
- Locked paths aren't mysteries - they're VISIBLE ALTERNATIVES representing rejected identities

**Sir Brante parallel PEAKS:**
- "I'm seeing the life I could have lived if I'd been a Commander instead"
- You MOURN unchosen builds while EMBRACING chosen identity
- This creates investment in future playthroughs and acceptance of trade-offs

**What to test:**
- Do I feel REGRET when I see locked paths I want?
- Do I think "I wish I'd invested in Rapport earlier"?
- Do I see EXACTLY what I'm missing (not mystery, but visible sacrifice)?
- Does this regret make me MORE invested in my chosen identity?

**Regret emotion:** FULLY EMERGED - you feel the weight of past choices

---

### The Sir Brante Model: "Seeing Life You Could Have Had"

**How it works:**
1. **Visible Requirements** - You see "Authority 5" even with Authority 2
2. **Clear Gap** - "Need 3 more Authority"
3. **Understanding Consequence** - You know EXACTLY what you're missing
4. **Irreversible Specialization** - Can't easily recover after focusing Insight for 3 hours
5. **Mourning Unchosen Paths** - "I see how a Commander would handle this, but I chose Investigator"

**The emotional payoff:**
- You ACCEPT your build through visible sacrifice
- Locked paths create APPRECIATION for unlocked paths
- Regret creates INVESTMENT in future playthroughs
- Specialization feels MEANINGFUL because alternatives are visible but costly

**Comparison baseline:** In Sir Brante, you see 3-4 paths per decision, 1-2 accessible to you, 1-2 blocked visibly. Wayfarer should feel similar: most situations show 3-4 choices, some stat-accessible (free), some stat-blocked (visible but can't take), one fallback (always available).

---

### What Playtesters Should Understand

### 1. Test the FEELING, Not the Mechanics
**Don't test:** "Are there enough stat-gated choices?"
**Do test:** "Do I feel REGRET when I see blocked paths? Does my past haunt my present?"

### 2. Play for MINIMUM 3-4 Hours
**Why:** Emotional arc takes time. Regret emerges in Hour 4, not Hour 1.

### 3. Sir Brante is the Reference
**If you've played Sir Brante:** Does Wayfarer create similar "seeing life you could have had" feeling?
**If you haven't:** Do you feel constraint from past choices? Do you mourn unchosen paths?

### 4. Contemplation Not Urgency
**Do test:** "Can I pause, calculate, and strategize? Do I trust the numbers?"

---

## Testing Lens: STRATEGIC Not TACTICAL

**WRONG approach (tactical testing):**
- "Scene X doesn't create enough tension"
- "This choice has an obvious answer"
- "Individual encounter feels too easy"
- Testing each decision point in isolation

**RIGHT approach (strategic testing):**
- "After 2 hours, do I feel resource pressure from cumulative choices?"
- "Does Investigator build play differently than Diplomat after 3 hours?"
- "Can I afford everything I want, or am I forced to prioritize over time?"
- "Do choices made in hour 1 constrain options in hour 3?"

**Play the game holistically as a STRATEGY game about long-term resource allocation, not a tactics game about individual hard decisions.**

## Tutorial Flow (First 15 Minutes)

**CRITICAL MECHANIC:** "Look Around" is MANDATORY for environmental interaction. NPCs and scenes require this action first.

**What Actually Happens** (verified from 22_a_story_tutorial.json):

### Scene a1: "Secure Lodging" (isStarter: true) - 3 SITUATIONS

A1 uses the InnLodging archetype with 3 cascading situations that teach the spatial model.

**SITUATION 1: Secure Lodging (Common Room)**
- **Where:** Common Room (inn with Commercial + Restful properties)
- **Who:** Elena (Innkeeper)
- **4 stat-building choices:** Rapport, Authority, Cunning, Diplomacy (each costs 5 coins)
- **After choice:** Player receives ExitToWorld routing → must navigate to Private Room

**SITUATION 2: Evening in Room (Private Room)**
- **Where:** Private Room (scene-created location, only accessible during A1)
- **Who:** No NPC
- **4 choices:** Read (+Insight), Plan route (+Cunning), Rest (+Health/Stamina/Focus), Visit common room (+Rapport)

**SITUATION 3: Morning Departure (Private Room)**
- **Where:** Private Room
- **Who:** No NPC
- **2 choices:** Both spawn A2 as Deferred scene
  - "Leave early" → +1 Cunning, spawns a2_morning
  - "Take time to socialize" → +1 Rapport, spawns a2_morning

**MANDATORY STEPS TO ACCESS A1:**
1. **Click "Look Around" action** (REQUIRED - discovers NPCs at location)
2. Wait for NPC list to appear (Elena - Innkeeper)
3. Click Elena's name to interact with her
4. Situation 1 displays with 4 stat-building choices
5. After Situation 1: Navigate to Private Room for Situations 2 and 3

### Scene a2: "First Delivery"
- **Activation:** When player enters Common Room after completing A1 (SemiPublic + Commercial)
- **Who:** General Merchant (at Common Room)
- **Archetype:** delivery_contract
- **Flow:** Contract offer → Contract negotiation
- **End:** Creates A3 as Deferred (immediately activates because Common Room matches A3 filter)
- **Access:** Click "Look Around" at Common Room after A1 completion

### Scene a3: "Journey Beyond Town"
- **Activation:** IMMEDIATELY after A2 completes (same location trigger as A2 - SemiPublic + Commercial)
- **Key mechanism:** A3 spawning must find/create route to another location
- **Player action:** Click route travel action → A3 Situation 1 starts
- **5 situations:** Route obstacles with stat gates (Authority, Insight, Rapport challenges)
- **Archetype:** route_segment_travel

**Testing Priority:** Verify the cascade: A1 (3 situations with Private Room navigation) → A2 (at Common Room) → A3 (immediate activation, route travel). Always use "Look Around" at each location.

---

## Known Implementation Gaps (Features Designed But Not Built)

**CRITICAL:** These features are fully documented in design docs but NOT implemented in current build. Testers should NOT report these as bugs - they're planned future features.

### 1. **Stat Reduction & Negative Consequences** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Design:** Choices can REDUCE stats or apply negative consequences. Crisis situations where all choices are damage control.
- Example: "Force the issue" → +3 Authority, -1 Rapport (asymmetric trade)
- Crisis: Every choice loses something (2 Health OR 15 coins OR 1 Rapport)

**Current Reality:** All stat changes are POSITIVE ONLY. No choices reduce stats. No crisis situations exist.

**What testers should verify:** Stats only increase, never decrease. Note this as expected limitation.

---

### 2. **Sweet Spots & Over-Specialization Penalties** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Design:** Authority 16+ triggers automatic negative consequences (domineering reputation, NPCs hostile, Social challenges start with increased Doubt).
- Optimal range: Stats 4-6 comfortable, 7-8 specialized, 9+ diminishing returns
- Over-specialization creates penalties, not just opportunity cost

**Current Reality:** Stats have NO ceiling penalties. "More is always better" - no sweet spots enforced.

**What testers should verify:** No penalties for high stats. Note that specialization creates ONLY opportunity cost (can't invest in other stats), not active penalties.

---

### 3. **NPC Access Gating** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Design:** Some NPCs require minimum stats to BEGIN interaction.
- Cannot approach Merchant without Rapport 2
- Cannot approach Guard Captain without Authority 2
- Cannot approach Thief Contact without Cunning 3

**Current Reality:** All NPCs accessible regardless of stats. Stat gates exist only at CHOICE level, not NPC level.

**What testers should verify:** Can interact with all NPCs from game start. Stat gates appear in conversation CHOICES, not NPC ACCESS.

---

### 4. **Equipment Stat Bonuses** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Design:** Equipment provides temporary stat boosts as strategic alternative to grinding.
- "+1 Insight Hat" costs 60-100 coins, grants temporary +1 Insight while owned
- Strategic choice: Grind stats over hours OR buy equipment for coins
- Bypass stat gates temporarily via economic investment

**Current Reality:** Equipment provides context-specific difficulty reduction (IntensityReduction), NOT stat bonuses.
- Example: Rope makes climbing easier but doesn't increase Authority stat
- Example: Quality Clothing helps Authority/Persuasion contexts but doesn't grant +1 Authority

**What testers should verify:**
- Equipment helps with specific challenge types but doesn't change stat displays
- Cannot bypass "Need Insight 5" gate by buying equipment
- Only stat grinding (playing challenge cards) increases stats

---

### 5. **Infinite A-Story Procedural Generation** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Design:** Infinite main storyline through procedural generation (Frieren model).

**How It Works:**
- **A1-A3: Authored tutorial** (teaches core systems, lighter stat gating by design)
- **A4+: Infinite procedural scenes** generated at runtime
  - Archetype rotation (investigation → social → confrontation → crisis)
  - Anti-repetition (no archetype twice in 5 scenes)
  - Tier escalation (sequence 1-30 Personal, 31-50 Local, 51+ Regional)
  - Categorical placement (locations/NPCs selected by properties, not IDs)

**Transition:** A3 completion → spawns A4 (procedurally generated) → A4 completion → spawns A5 → forever

**What testers should verify:**
- **A3 completes and spawns A4** (should appear seamlessly - this is the FIRST procedural scene)
- A4+ scenes feel like natural continuation (same quality, different content)
- No repetition across consecutive A-scenes (different archetypes, different NPCs)
- Can play for 4+ hours and A-story continues infinitely

**Emotional Arc Testing:** Hour 4+ emotional arc (regret, specialization vulnerability) REQUIRES procedural content. If you complete A3 and don't see A4, report as CRITICAL BUG.

**Note:** Tutorial is currently A1-A3 (3 authored scenes). Design goal is A1-A10 (10 authored scenes), at which point procedural would start at A11. Architecture works with ANY number of authored scenes - if tutorial expands to A1-A10 later, no code changes needed.

## How to Test Using Playwright

**Verified Selectors** (from actual GameScreen.razor code):

### Resource Display
```javascript
// Verified from ResourceBar.razor (.resource-item as container)
// Structure: .resource-item > .resource-label + .resource-value + .resource-bar
const health = await page.locator('.resource-item .resource-value').nth(0).textContent();
const hunger = await page.locator('.resource-item .resource-value').nth(1).textContent();
const focus = await page.locator('.resource-item .resource-value').nth(2).textContent();
const coins = await page.locator('.resource-item .resource-value').nth(4).textContent();

// Alternative: target by label (more resilient)
const health = await page.locator('.resource-item:has(.resource-label:text("Health")) .resource-value').textContent();
```

### Time Display
```javascript
// Verified: time-header contains day-display and period-name
const day = await page.locator('.day-display').textContent();
const period = await page.locator('.period-name').textContent();
```

### Active Delivery
```javascript
// Verified: active-job-banner appears when delivery active
const hasActiveJob = await page.locator('.active-job-banner').isVisible();
const payment = await page.locator('.active-job-payment').textContent();
```

### Navigation
```javascript
// Verified: fixed-buttons-container has journal-btn and map-btn
await page.click('.journal-btn');
await page.click('.map-btn');
```

### Modals
```javascript
// Verified: modal-overlay wraps modal-content
const modalOpen = await page.locator('.modal-overlay').isVisible();
// Close modal - click overlay (stopPropagation on content)
await page.click('.modal-overlay');
```

### Stat-Gated Choices (CRITICAL FOR TESTING)
```javascript
// LOCKED choice (stat-gated or unaffordable)
const lockedChoice = await page.locator('.scene-choice-card.locked');

// Lock indicator section (red banner with padlock)
const lockIndicator = await page.locator('.scene-locked-indicator');

// "UNAVAILABLE" text
const lockTitle = await page.locator('.lock-title');
await expect(lockTitle).toHaveText('UNAVAILABLE');

// Requirement gaps (shows exact missing stats)
const requirementGaps = await page.locator('.requirement-gap');
// Example text: "Need Insight 5 (you have 3)"

// Verify locked choice has dashed border
const borderStyle = await lockedChoice.evaluate(el =>
  window.getComputedStyle(el).borderStyle
);
expect(borderStyle).toBe('dashed');

// AVAILABLE choice (can be selected)
const availableChoice = await page.locator('.scene-choice-card:not(.locked)');

// Verify available choice has solid border and hover effect
await availableChoice.hover();
const transform = await availableChoice.evaluate(el =>
  window.getComputedStyle(el).transform
);
expect(transform).not.toBe('none'); // Should lift up on hover
```

**Visual Indicators (No DevTools Needed):**
- **Locked choice:** Dashed border, grayed background, 🔒 UNAVAILABLE banner (red), no hover effect
- **Available choice:** Solid border, bright background, lifts up on hover
- **Requirement text:** Red, indented, shows exact gap: "Need Insight 5 (you have 3)"
- **Cursor:** Locked = circle-slash (not-allowed), Available = pointer (hand)

**Critical Test:** Verify perfect information - all costs AND stat requirements visible BEFORE player commits to choice.

---

## Critical Issues to Test For

**Based on verified design goals** (from design/01_design_vision.md and design/02_core_gameplay_loops.md):

### 1. Soft-Locks (BREAKING)
**Why Critical:** Infinite game cannot restart. Unwinnable states = permanent failure.

**Test:**
- Deplete all resources to zero
- Verify fallback path always exists (no-requirement option)
- Check every location has exit action
- Confirm scenes don't trap player

**Expected:** Always forward progress, even if suboptimal.

### 2. Perfect Information Violation (MAJOR)
**Why Critical:** Core pillar = "see all costs before committing" (design/01_design_vision.md § Anti-Goals: Not a Power Fantasy)

**Test:**
- Every choice must show exact costs BEFORE selection
- No hidden consequences that surprise player
- Requirements shown with current player value
- Final resource values displayed (Current → Final format)

**Expected:** Can calculate multi-step strategies. Trust the numbers.

### 3. Stat Gating Doesn't Constrain (MAJOR)
**Why Critical:** Stat requirements should block desired choices, creating tension (design/03_progression_systems.md § Stat Gating Effects)

**Test:**
- Do I see stat-gated choices I WANT but can't take?
- After specializing for 2 hours, am I blocked from non-specialized content?
- Do requirements show exact gap ("Need Insight 5, you have 3")?
- Am I forced to invest in unwanted stats to unlock gated content?

**Expected:** Specialization creates vulnerability. Investigator blocked from Social paths. Diplomat blocked from Mental paths. Requirements visible with exact gaps.

**Red Flags:**
- All choices available regardless of stats (gating not working)
- Can't see what's required to unlock choices (perfect information broken)
- Never feel constrained by past stat investments (consequences not cumulative)

### 4. Scarcity Disappears (MAJOR)
**Why Critical:** "No power fantasy" - resources must stay scarce (design/01_design_vision.md § Anti-Goals: Not a Power Fantasy)

**Test:**
- Do costs still matter after 20 deliveries?
- Does player reach "unstoppable" state?
- Are late-game challenges still challenging?

**Expected:** Economic pressure persists. Never trivial.

### 5. Strategic Constraints Don't Emerge (MAJOR)
**Why Critical:** "Impossible choices" emerge from cumulative stat consequences over hours (design/01_design_vision.md § Core Experience Statement)

**Test (STRATEGIC - requires 2-4 hour playthrough):**
- After 2 hours of Insight investment: Are Social choices NOW blocked due to low Rapport?
- After 3 hours: Do early stat allocations create CURRENT vulnerability?
- Across playthrough: Do I see choices I WANT but can't afford (stat requirements)?
- Do I feel forced to pick stat increases I don't want to unlock gated content?

**Expected:** Stat specialization creates constraint. Past stat investment blocks current desired paths. "I can access A OR B based on my stats, not both" emerges.

**Economic Pressure** (secondary to stat gating):
- After 10 deliveries, can I afford occasional equipment? (Should be tight but possible)
- Do coins create tension but NOT dominant constraint? (Stats primary, coins secondary)

**DON'T test:** Whether individual choices feel hard tactically (they often won't - and that's CORRECT for Sir Brante model).

### 6. Route Segments Don't Learn (MEDIUM)
**Why Critical:** Route mastery = core skill progression (design/02_core_gameplay_loops.md § Segment Types: Fixed Environmental)

**Test:**
- First travel: Segments face-down (unknown)
- Second travel: Fixed segments face-up showing exact costs
- Third travel: Can plan perfect resource allocation

**Expected:** Learning routes enables profitable optimization.

### 7. Tutorial Doesn't Spawn (BREAKING)
**Why Critical:** a1_secure_lodging has `isStarter: true` - must appear (22_a_story_tutorial.json)

**Verified Code Path:**
1. GameFacade.StartGameAsync() called when game starts
2. Queries `_gameWorld.SceneTemplates.Where(t => t.IsStarter)` to find tutorial scenes
3. For each starter template, calls SceneInstantiator to create Scene instance
4. Scene placed at location/NPC matching template's PlacementFilter
5. Scene becomes active, choices appear in UI

**Automated Test:** `TutorialInnLodgingIntegrationTest.Tutorial_LoadsSceneTemplates()` verifies IsStarter scenes exist

**Manual Test:**
- Game start → Scene a1 appears at Common Room with Elena
- Can complete all three tutorial scenes (a1, a2, a3)
- Each scene teaches intended system

**If fails:** Run `dotnet test --filter "Tutorial_LoadsSceneTemplates"` to isolate issue

**Expected:** Smooth onboarding, no confusion.

## Player Personas for Testing

**Based on verified build specializations** (from design/02_core_gameplay_loops.md, design/03_progression_systems.md):

### Persona 1: The Economic Optimizer
**Focus:** Resource management and profit maximization

**Playstyle:**
- Learn routes to face-up all fixed segments (route mastery)
- Calculate multi-step economic strategies
- Minimize costs, maximize earnings
- Avoid risky challenges unless expected value positive

**What to Test:**
- Can calculate delivery profitability accurately?
- Do margins feel tight enough to require optimization?
- Does route learning provide measurable advantage?
- Is equipment affordable within reasonable deliveries (10-15)?

**Success:** Maintains positive coins over 10 cycles through skill, not luck.

### Persona 2: The Investigator Build (Insight + Cunning)
**Focus:** Mental challenge specialization

**Playstyle:**
- Prioritize Insight and Cunning stat increases
- Seek out Mental challenges and investigations
- Expect to dominate Mental, struggle in Social
- Forced into expensive/slow paths when lacking social stats

**What to Test:**
- Do Insight-gated paths appear frequently?
- Are Social situations genuinely harder with low Rapport?
- Does specialization create distinct experience?
- Is vulnerability meaningful but not punishing?

**Success:** Mental challenges feel easy, Social situations force costly workarounds.

### Persona 3: The Diplomat Build (Rapport + Diplomacy)
**Focus:** Social challenge specialization

**Playstyle:**
- Prioritize Rapport and Diplomacy stat increases
- Build NPC relationships for mechanical benefits
- Expect to dominate Social, struggle in Mental
- Relationship investment over equipment

**What to Test:**
- Do Rapport-gated paths provide genuine advantage?
- Are Mental situations genuinely harder with low Insight?
- Does NPC relationship progression feel rewarding?
- Do bond benefits (shortcuts, discounts) justify investment?

**Success:** Social challenges feel easy, Mental situations force expensive choices.

### Persona 4: The Stress Tester (Edge Cases)
**Focus:** Breaking the game through suboptimal play

**Playstyle:**
- Deliberately make worst choices
- Deplete resources to zero
- Choose only fallback paths
- Test boundary conditions

**What to Test:**
- Does game soft-lock with zero resources?
- Do fallback paths always exist?
- Can recover from near-bankruptcy?
- Do edge cases crash or corrupt state?

**Success:** Game never breaks, always has forward path (even if slow).

**Testing Strategy:** Use different personas in parallel to cover all critical systems. Optimizer tests economy, Builds test specialization, Stress Tester tests robustness.

## Testing Session Quick Start

**CRITICAL: This is STRATEGIC testing requiring MINIMUM 2-4 hour playthroughs.**

Individual choices/scenes tested in isolation = WRONG. You're testing cumulative patterns across time.

**Mindset:**
- Not: "Is this choice hard?"
- But: "After 2 hours, do my choices create constraints?"

**Time commitment:**
- Minimum: 2 hours (to see economic patterns)
- Recommended: 3-4 hours (to see build specialization)
- Per persona: Run separate 3-hour sessions as Optimizer, Investigator, Diplomat

---

### 1. Setup (5 min)
```bash
cd src
dotnet build
ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://localhost:<PORT>" dotnet run
```
- Use any port in 5000-5999 range
- Navigate browser to: http://localhost:<PORT>

### 2. Verify Startup (2 min)
**Check server console logs:**
- Content loading messages
- GameWorld initialized
- Server listening

**Check browser:**
- Game container loads (`.game-container`)
- Time header visible (`.time-header`)
- Resources bar visible (`.resources-bar`)
- No JavaScript errors in console

**Open Browser DevTools (F12) - KEEP OPEN ENTIRE SESSION:**
Press F12, click Console tab. This is MANDATORY for detecting connection issues.

### 3. CRITICAL: Console Monitoring Protocol (MANDATORY EVERY ACTION)

**After EVERY action (button click, choice selection, navigation):**
1. Check browser console (F12 → Console tab) for errors
2. Look for these CRITICAL errors:
   - ❌ **"No interop methods are registered for renderer"** → Connection broken
   - ❌ **"WebSocket closed with status code: 1006"** → Connection lost
   - ❌ **"Failed to complete negotiation"** → Server unreachable
   - ✅ **No errors** → Action successful, continue

**If connection breaks:**
- Refresh page immediately (Ctrl+R or F5)
- Note time in playtest log: "Session interrupted at [time] - Blazor circuit disconnected"
- Continue from where you were (Blazor Server state persists server-side)

**Expected during 3-4 hour sessions:**
- 1-2 disconnections = NORMAL (Blazor Server timeout behavior)
- 3+ disconnections = Report as stability issue

**Why This Matters:**
Actions may appear to work (button press visible) but silently fail if connection dropped. NO visual feedback shown to player. Without console monitoring, entire playtest session can be invalidated by undetected connection loss.

### 4. Tutorial Verification (10 min)
**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:**
1. **Click "Look Around" action** at Common Room
2. Wait 2-3 seconds for Blazor update
3. Verify Elena (Innkeeper) appears in NPC list
4. Click Elena's name to interact
5. "Secure Lodging" scene should now display

**Scene a1 verification:**
- Tutorial scene "Secure Lodging" displays with 4 stat-building choices
- Verify EVERY choice shows costs before selection
- Check console for errors after each click

**Complete a1 → a2 → a3 tutorial sequence:**
- Remember: Use "Look Around" at EACH new location before expecting NPCs/scenes
- Check console after EVERY action

### 5. Core Experience Test: The Emotional Arc (3-4 hours MINIMUM)

**THE PRIMARY EXPERIENCE TO TEST:**

**NOT:** "Can I calculate profit margins accurately?"
**NOT:** "Are there enough stat-gated choices?"
**YES:** "Do I feel REGRET when I see the life I could have had?"

**Play for 3-4 HOURS minimum to experience the full emotional arc.**

---

### Hour-by-Hour Emotional Tracking

**Hour 1 - Identity Building:**
- [ ] Do I feel FREE to explore different stat paths without pressure?
- [ ] Are choices based on PERSONALITY not optimization?
- [ ] No stat gates yet (all grants, no requirements)?

**Hour 2 - First Gates Appear:**
- [ ] Do I see stat-gated choices that feel ASPIRATIONAL (not punishing)?
- [ ] Can I see exact gap? ("Need Insight 5, you have 3")
- [ ] Do locked paths make me think "I want to work toward that"?
- [ ] Still have 3+ viable paths (gates don't block progression)?

**Hour 3 - Validation & Constraint:**
- [ ] Do I feel POWERFUL in my specialized area?
- [ ] Do I notice I'm WEAKER in non-specialized areas?
- [ ] First REGRET emotion: "If I'd chosen Authority in Hour 1, I could take that path now"
- [ ] Does my identity feel DISTINCT from other builds?

**Hour 4+ - "I See the Life I Could Have Had":**
- [ ] Do I feel PAINFUL vulnerability in non-specialized areas?
- [ ] Do I see Authority 6 paths and think "I WISH I could take that"?
- [ ] Do I MOURN unchosen builds while EMBRACING chosen identity?
- [ ] Does regret make me MORE invested (want to replay as different build)?

---

### The Regret Emotion Test (CRITICAL)

**After 3-4 hours, ask yourself:**

1. **Do I see the life I could have had?**
   - Are locked paths VISIBLE (not mystery gates)?
   - Do I know EXACTLY what I'm missing?
   - Can I imagine how a different build would handle this?

2. **Do I feel regret for unchosen paths?**
   - "I wish I'd invested in Rapport earlier"
   - "I see how a Commander would solve this elegantly, but I chose Investigator"
   - Does this regret feel MEANINGFUL (not frustrating)?

3. **Does regret create investment?**
   - Do I want to replay as different build to access locked paths?
   - Do I ACCEPT my build identity through visible sacrifice?
   - Do locked paths make me APPRECIATE unlocked paths more?

**If you answer NO to these:** Emotional arc is not working. Report as "regret emotion not emerging."

---

### Stat Gating Moments (Write These Down)

**What to track throughout playthrough:**
- "I saw a choice I WANTED but it was blocked - needed Insight 5, I have 3"
- "I was forced to take expensive coin path because I lack stat-gated free path"
- "This situation has 4 choices but only 2 are available to me"
- "I picked a stat increase I didn't WANT just to unlock gated content I NEED"
- "My past stat choices created THIS vulnerability I'm feeling NOW"

---

### Questions After 3-4 Hours

1. **Regret for path not taken:**
   - Do I mourn unchosen builds?
   - Do I see exactly what I'm missing?
   - Does this make future playthroughs appealing?

2. **Past choices constrain present:**
   - After specializing Investigator (Insight+Cunning), are Social paths blocked?
   - Does vulnerability HURT (not just "I notice it")?
   - Do I regret past stat allocation when facing current gates?

3. **Forced stat allocation:**
   - Do I ever choose stats I don't want to unlock gated content?
   - Does this feel strategic or just frustrating?

4. **Sir Brante comparison:**
   - Does it feel like Sir Brante's "impossible choices"?
   - Do I see 3-4 paths, 1-2 accessible, 1-2 blocked visibly?
   - Does specialization create identity, not just numbers?

**Simple Economic Check** (secondary to emotional experience):
- After 10 deliveries, can you survive? (Yes = working)
- Can you afford equipment eventually? (Should take ~10-15 deliveries = working)
- Coins create tension but NOT dominant constraint? (Stats primary = working)

### 5. Perfect Information Audit (10 min)
**Every single choice across all screens:**
- Costs visible BEFORE selection?
- Requirements shown with player's current value?
- Final values displayed (Current → Final)?
- No surprise consequences?

**Test with Playwright:**
```javascript
// Verify every choice card has consequences section
const choices = await page.locator('.scene-choice-card').count();
for (let i = 0; i < choices; i++) {
  const card = page.locator('.scene-choice-card').nth(i);
  await expect(card.locator('.choice-consequences')).toBeVisible();
}
```

### 6. Soft-Lock Test (10 min)
**As Stress Tester:**
1. Spend all coins on bad choices
2. Deplete energy/hunger to critical
3. Verify fallback paths always exist
4. Confirm no unwinnable states
5. Test recovery from near-zero resources

### 7. Build Specialization Test: Stat Gating Creates Distinct Experiences (3-4 hours PER build)
**CRITICAL: Run SEPARATE 3-hour playthroughs for each build to compare stat gating patterns.**

**Session A - As Investigator (3 hours):**
1. **Stat investment:** Always pick Insight + Cunning increases when offered
2. **After 2-3 hours of cumulative stat allocation:**

   **Stat Gating Observations:**
   - How many Mental choices are stat-gated to me? (Should be HIGH - I meet requirements)
   - How many Social choices are stat-gated to me? (Should be HIGH - I DON'T meet requirements)
   - Am I forced to use expensive coin paths in Social situations because I lack Rapport?
   - Do I see choices I WANT but can't take due to low Rapport/Diplomacy?

   **The Feeling:**
   - Do I feel POWERFUL in Mental situations (many free stat-gated paths)?
   - Do I feel BLOCKED in Social situations (desired choices locked)?
   - Does my past Insight investment NOW constrain my Social options?

**Session B - As Diplomat (3 hours):**
1. **Stat investment:** Always pick Rapport + Diplomacy increases when offered
2. **After 2-3 hours of cumulative stat allocation:**

   **Stat Gating Observations:**
   - How many Social choices are stat-gated to me? (Should be HIGH - I meet requirements)
   - How many Mental choices are stat-gated to me? (Should be HIGH - I DON'T meet requirements)
   - Am I forced to use expensive coin paths in Mental situations because I lack Insight?
   - Do I see choices I WANT but can't take due to low Insight/Cunning?

   **The Feeling:**
   - Do I feel POWERFUL in Social situations (many free stat-gated paths)?
   - Do I feel BLOCKED in Mental situations (desired choices locked)?
   - Does my past Rapport investment NOW constrain my Mental options?

**Compare after BOTH 3-hour sessions:**
- **Stat gating pattern:** Did Investigator see different locked choices than Diplomat?
- **Vulnerability:** Did specialization create DISTINCT constraints?
- **Choice pressure:** Did I feel "forced to pick stat increases I don't want" in different situations?
- **Experience:** Did the game FEEL different based on what I can/can't access?

**Success = Different builds see different constraints through stat gating, not just different numbers.**

### 8. Report Critical Issues
**BREAKING (stop testing):**
- Soft-locks
- Tutorial doesn't spawn
- Crashes/state corruption

**MAJOR (continue but note):**
- Perfect information violations
- Economic imbalance over 2 hours (too easy/hard)
- Scarcity doesn't emerge across multiple playthroughs
- Strategic constraints don't appear after cumulative choices

**MEDIUM (note for later):**
- Route learning doesn't work
- Build differentiation weak
- UI unclear

## Success Criteria Summary

**REMEMBER: Test STRATEGICALLY across 2-4 hour playthroughs, not tactically per individual choice.**

✅ **Tutorial completes** (a1 → a2 → a3 teaches core systems)
✅ **No soft-locks** (always forward path, even with zero resources)
✅ **Perfect information** (all costs AND stat requirements visible before commitment)
✅ **Stat gating creates tension** (I see choices I WANT but can't take due to stat requirements)
✅ **Past stats constrain current choices** (2 hours of Insight investment NOW blocks Social paths)
✅ **Forced stat allocation** (picking stat increases I don't want to unlock gated content I need)
✅ **Strategic constraints EMERGE** ("I can access A OR B based on my stats, not both")
✅ **Builds differ through gating** (Investigator sees different blocked choices than Diplomat)

**Economic pressure** (secondary):
- Coins tight enough to matter but NOT dominant constraint
- Equipment affordable ~10-15 deliveries
- Can survive but feel resource pressure

**Timeframe matters:** Stat consequences emerge over HOURS through cumulative allocation, not individual encounters.
