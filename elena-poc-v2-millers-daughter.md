# Wayfarer POC: The Miller's Daughter

## Scenario Overview

### The Story

Elena, a town scribe, needs urgent legal documents delivered to an outlying farmstead. The route is difficult - crossing either a dangerous creek or passing through an abandoned mill with dark history. Heavy rains come in three days, making the creek impassable for a week. Elena is apologetic about the difficulty but the elderly farmer cannot travel to town.

This POC demonstrates how obligations drive exploration, investigation becomes active problem-solving, travel presents real obstacles, and conversations serve adventure goals. Success requires information gathering, preparation, equipment acquisition, and careful decision-making.

### The Core Challenge

Navigate to remote farmstead through dangerous terrain while uncovering a decade-old mystery at the abandoned mill. The challenge layers:
- Conversation with Elena to accept obligation and gather initial information
- Conversation with tavern cook to learn about routes and mill history
- Resource preparation (equipment, supplies, coins)
- Active investigation at the mill (multi-phase with choices and dangers)
- Travel obstacle navigation (creek crossing or mill passage)
- Final delivery and mystery resolution

### Success Criteria

- Successfully deliver Elena's documents before weather makes route impassable (3-day window)
- Navigate travel obstacles through preparation and good choices
- Investigate mill mystery through careful exploration
- Manage resources (health, stamina, coins, time, equipment)
- Build relationships through completed obligation and shared discoveries

## NPCs

### Elena - The Town Scribe

**Location**: Elena's Office (Morning through Afternoon)
**Personality**: Devoted (Doubt accumulates +2 instead of +1)
**Relationship**: None yet (first meeting)

**Introduction** (Authored Scene):
"The scribe's office is neat despite the volume of documents. Elena looks up from her work with tired eyes. 'You're the courier?' She assesses you carefully. 'I need documents delivered to Farmer Aldric's stead. It's... not an easy journey. The direct path crosses Widow's Creek - dangerous even in good weather. The mill path is longer but has a crossing, though locals avoid the mill itself. Heavy rains are coming in three days.' She pauses. 'I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. Aldric is elderly, these documents are time-sensitive legal matters. Will you help?'"

**Conversation Options**:
- Information Gathering: Learn about routes, urgency, payment
- Desperate Request: Accept obligation and get details
- Friendly Chat: Build initial rapport

**Request Details**:
- Destination: Farmer Aldric's Stead (remote farmstead)
- Weight: 1 (legal documents in weatherproof case)
- Payment: 8 coins on successful delivery
- Deadline: Before heavy rains (Day 4, Morning)
- Notes: Urgent, elderly farmer cannot travel

### Martha - The Tavern Cook

**Location**: Tavern (all day, busiest during meals)
**Personality**: Steadfast (All effects capped at ±2)
**Relationship**: Local familiarity (grew up in area)

**First Conversation**:
Friendly local who knows the countryside. Information Gathering conversation type available immediately.

**Information Provided**:
- **About the creek**: "Widow's Creek is dangerous. Current's strong even now. One slip and you're swept away. After rains? Impassable for a week."
- **About the mill**: "Old grain mill, abandoned for years. My family farmed nearby before moving to town. The mill... locals avoid it. Superstitious mostly."
- **About her daughter** (if pressed): "My daughter disappeared near there a decade ago. Anna. She was curious, always exploring. Went to investigate the mill one day, never came back. No body found. The mill's wheel mechanism was dangerous even when operational."
- **Route advice**: "The mill path is longer but has safe crossing upstream of the wheel. You'd have to go through the mill building though - the path continues on the far side. Bring light, it'll be dark inside."

**Mechanical Benefits**:
- Route knowledge (mill path exists, crossing location)
- Investigation context (daughter's disappearance, mechanism danger)
- Equipment advice (need light source)
- Historical background (family connection, mill history)

### Thomas - The Equipment Vendor

**Location**: Market (Morning through Afternoon)
**Personality**: Mercantile (Highest Initiative card gets bonus)
**Relationship**: None (business transaction)

**Available Items**:
- Rope (2 coins, weight 2): "Good hemp rope. Useful for climbing or securing unstable things."
- Lantern Oil (1 coin, weight 1): "Two hours of light. Careful with the flame."
- Warm Cloak (3 coins, weight 1): "Weather's turning. Stay dry, stay alive."
- Basic Tools (2 coins, weight 2): "Prying bar, small hammer. Never know when you need to force something."
- Rations (1 coin, weight 1): "Trail food. Keeps you going."

## Investigation Structure: The Mill

### Overview

The mill is a multi-layered investigation requiring:
- Physical navigation of dangerous structure
- Evidence gathering about the daughter's disappearance
- Mechanism puzzle with structural collapse risk
- Social danger from others interested in mill secrets
- State persistence allowing retreat and return

### Investigation Phase 1: Approach

**Location**: Mill exterior, overgrown path
**Time Cost**: 1 segment
**Stamina Cost**: 10 (rough terrain)

**Description**:
"The abandoned mill looms ahead, wheel frozen mid-rotation, moss-covered and decaying. The path is overgrown - clearly no one uses this route anymore. The building itself shows structural damage, gaps in the walls, sagging roofline. The creek flows beyond it, louder here near the wheel mechanism."

**Choices**:

**Option 1: Front Door (Blocked)**
- Partially collapsed
- Requires: Tools to clear, or high Stamina to force
- Result: If forced without tools, lose 10 health from debris fall
- Result: If cleared with tools, safe entry but 2 segments

**Option 2: Search for Alternate Entry**
- Exploration attempt
- Time Cost: 1 segment
- Result: Discover side loading door (wedged but forceable with rope)

**Option 3: Observe First**
- Careful assessment before entering
- Time Cost: 1 segment
- Requires: Insight 2+ for detailed structural analysis
- Result: Learn about upper floor danger, mechanism instability, recent footprints

**Optimal**: Search for alternate entry (finds side door), use rope if available.

### Investigation Phase 2: Entry and Interior

**Location**: Mill main floor
**Time Cost**: 1 segment
**Requirements**: Light source (lantern) or accept darkness penalties

**With Light**:
"Your lantern reveals the mill's interior. Decades of abandonment evident - rotted grain bags, rusted tools, structural decay. The massive grinding mechanism dominates the space, wheel shaft running through the wall to the waterwheel outside. A loft above with questionable flooring. Fresh disturbance in the dust - someone has been here recently."

**Without Light**:
"Darkness inside is absolute. You can hear water, sense the mechanism's bulk, but see almost nothing. Moving forward is dangerous without light."

**Choices**:

**Option 1: Quick Passage to Far Exit**
- Time Cost: 1 segment
- Safe but learn nothing
- Reach crossing point on far side
- Result: Complete delivery but miss mystery

**Option 2: Examine the Mechanism**
- Time Cost: 1 segment
- Stamina Cost: 15 (climbing, maneuvering)
- Danger: Structural collapse risk if careless
- Result: Discover mechanism has hidden compartment in gear housing

**Option 3: Investigate Upper Loft**
- Time Cost: 1 segment
- Danger: Floor stability questionable (lose 20 health if falls through)
- Requires: Rope for safety, or Insight 2+ to assess floor strength
- Result: Find recent occupation evidence - bedroll, journal, sketching materials

**Option 4: Search for Clues About Martha's Daughter**
- Time Cost: 2 segments (thorough search)
- Requires: Martha's story for context
- Result: Find old torn fabric matching decade-old description, evidence of confrontation

**State Saves**: Any discovered information persists. Can exit and return. Mill state doesn't reset.

### Investigation Phase 3: The Mechanism Puzzle

**Location**: Gear housing access
**Requirements**: Mechanism discovery from Phase 2
**Time Cost**: 2 segments
**Danger**: High collapse risk

**Description**:
"The gear housing has an access panel, corroded but visible. The mechanism hasn't moved in years, but the structure is unstable. Wrong approach could trigger partial collapse."

**Choices**:

**Option 1: Force Panel Open**
- Quick (1 segment)
- High risk: 50% chance of collapse (lose 30 health, alert anyone nearby)
- Success: Access compartment
- Failure: Injury and noise, but can try again after recovery

**Option 2: Carefully Work Panel Loose**
- Slow (2 segments)
- Moderate risk: 20% chance of minor collapse (lose 10 health)
- Stamina Cost: 20 (sustained careful effort)
- Success: Safe access to compartment

**Option 3: Stabilize Structure First**
- Very slow (3 segments)
- Requires: Rope and tools
- Zero risk: Safe access guaranteed
- Stamina Cost: 30 (heavy work)
- Best option if prepared and not rushed

**Compartment Contents**:
- Old ledgers: Document smuggling operation 10 years ago
- Names in ledgers: Include current town elder
- Token: Belongs to Martha's daughter (proof she found this)
- Evidence: Daughter discovered smuggling, was silenced

### Investigation Phase 4: Confrontation Risk

**Trigger**: If you take time investigating deeply (Phase 3 especially)
**Event**: Others arrive - the cook's granddaughter with town elder

**Context**:
The cook's granddaughter (Martha's family) has been independently researching her aunt's disappearance. She's bringing town elder to review her findings, not knowing he's implicated in the ledgers you just found.

**Situation**:
You're inside with evidence when they arrive outside. Voices audible:
- Granddaughter: "I think Aunt Anna discovered something here. The old records mention the mill."
- Elder: "Let me see. I'll help you understand what happened." (His voice tense - he knows what's hidden)

**Choices**:

**Option 1: Reveal Yourself Immediately**
- Confront elder with evidence
- Protect granddaughter from dangerous man
- Risk: Physical confrontation if he panics
- Outcome: Expose truth, but potential violence

**Option 2: Hide and Listen**
- Observe situation safely
- Gather more information
- Risk: Granddaughter enters mill alone with elder
- Outcome: She might be at risk, but you can intervene

**Option 3: Exit Through Back With Evidence**
- Avoid confrontation entirely
- Take ledgers to authorities
- Safest for you
- Risk: Leave granddaughter potentially at risk with elder

**Option 4: Call Out Warning to Granddaughter**
- Alert her to danger without full confrontation
- She realizes something's wrong
- Elder must choose: flee or explain
- Outcome: Defuse without violence, truth comes out gradually

**Resolution** (if handled well):
- Granddaughter isn't alone, brought others
- Elder's guilt exposed through confrontation
- Martha gains closure about daughter
- Mill's secrets revealed

## Travel Obstacles

### Route 1: Widow's Creek Direct

**Distance**: Town Outskirts → Farmstead (4 segments if successful)
**Danger**: Water crossing without bridge

**Obstacle - The Creek Crossing**:

**First Arrival** (after 2 segments travel):
"Widow's Creek runs fast and cold. The ford here is maybe fifteen feet across, but the current is strong. Water's thigh-deep at the shallowest point. Your footing will be uncertain, and one slip means you're swept downstream."

**Choices**:

**Option 1: Wade Across Directly**
- Requires: Stamina 40+
- Risk: High (60% chance of failure)
- Failure Result: Swept downstream, lose 30 health, lose 20 stamina, documents get wet (might be ruined), washed up 3 segments away
- Success Result: Cross safely, continue to farmstead (2 more segments)

**Option 2: Search for Shallower Crossing**
- Time Cost: 2 segments searching
- Requires: Insight 2+ for effective search
- Result: Find slightly better spot (reduces risk to 40%)
- Still dangerous without proper preparation

**Option 3: Turn Back to Try Mill Route**
- Admit defeat
- No loss except time spent
- Mill route becomes necessary
- Learn: Need better preparation or different route

**Weather Factor**:
If attempted after rain starts: Impossible, must use mill route or wait a week.

### Route 2: Mill Path

**Distance**: Town Outskirts → Mill → Farmstead (6 segments base + mill investigation time)
**Benefits**: Safe crossing upstream of wheel, avoids creek danger
**Challenges**: Must navigate mill interior, investigation opportunities/dangers

**Segment 1-2: Approach Mill**
- Overgrown forest path
- Stamina Cost: 10 per segment
- No special dangers with basic preparation

**Segment 3-?: Mill Investigation** (detailed above)
- Minimum 1 segment (quick passage)
- 4-8 segments (thorough investigation)
- State persists if you leave and return

**Segment ?-?: Mill to Farmstead**
- Safe crossing via mill's upstream access
- Clear maintained path beyond mill (farmer's route)
- 2 segments to reach farmstead
- No additional obstacles

## Timeline and Resource Management

### Day 1

**Morning Block**:
- Segment 1: Conversation with Elena (accept obligation)
- Segment 2-3: Conversation with Martha (gather route information)
- Segment 4: Decision point - prepare or attempt route

**Midday Block**:
- Option A: Work for coins (4 segments, earn 5 coins)
- Option B: Purchase equipment at market (1-2 segments)
- Option C: First route attempt (if feeling brave/unprepared)

**Afternoon Block**:
- Route attempt if prepared
- Or: More preparation, rest, planning

**Decision Points**:
- Accept Elena's request vs decline (decline means no adventure)
- Talk to Martha vs don't (missing crucial information)
- Purchase equipment vs go unprepared (risk vs resource trade-off)
- Attempt creek vs try mill (danger vs mystery)
- Investigate mill thoroughly vs quick passage (time vs discovery)

### Day 2-3

**Time Pressure**:
Weather coming Day 4. Each day spent preparing reduces available buffer but improves chances.

**Possible Patterns**:

**Aggressive**: Day 1 quick attempt, possibly fail, learn, retry
**Thorough**: Day 1-2 full preparation, Day 2-3 well-executed attempt
**Exploration-Focused**: Day 1-3 deep mill investigation, barely make deadline

### Resource Balance

**Coins**:
- Start: 15
- Equipment needed: 6-8 for full preparation
- Work income: 5 per block worked
- Delivery payment: 8 on success
- Must balance: preparation cost vs time spent earning

**Stamina**:
- Start: 100
- Travel costs: 10-20 per segment
- Investigation costs: 15-30 per phase
- Recovery: 40 per rest block, or 20 per meal
- Critical: Don't deplete before challenges

**Health**:
- Start: 100
- Danger from: Falls, collapses, crossing failures
- Recovery: Slow (rest blocks), or expensive (medicine)
- Critical: Below 30 significantly increases danger

**Time**:
- Available: 23 segments before deadline (nearly 4 days)
- Generous but not unlimited
- Spent on: Travel (6-10), investigation (4-12), preparation (1-8)
- Buffer allows mistakes and learning

## Optimal Strategies

### Careful Preparation Route

**Day 1 Morning**:
- Segment 1: Accept Elena's obligation (+1 weight documents)
- Segment 2-3: Information gathering from Martha
- Segment 4: Purchase rope and lantern oil (3 coins, +3 weight)

**Day 1 Midday**:
- Segment 1-2: Travel to mill
- Segment 3: Search for alternate entry (find side door)
- Segment 4: Enter mill with light

**Day 1 Afternoon**:
- Segment 1: Quick examination (see mechanism, note upper loft)
- Segment 2-3: Continue to farmstead via crossing
- Segment 4: Deliver documents successfully

**Result**: Complete delivery safely, notice mystery but don't investigate deeply. Fast but learn less.

### Investigation-Focused Route

**Day 1 Full Day**:
- Morning: Accept obligation, gather information, purchase equipment
- Midday: Work for additional coins (tools purchase)
- Afternoon: Rest, final preparation

**Day 2**:
- Morning-Midday: Travel to mill, thorough investigation (all phases)
- Afternoon: Complete delivery after investigation

**Result**: Solve mill mystery, help Martha find closure, still deliver on time. More time investment, greater narrative payoff.

### Aggressive Learning Route

**Day 1**:
- Morning: Accept obligation, minimal information gathering
- Midday: Attempt creek crossing without preparation
- Fail, get injured and swept downstream
- Learn: Need different approach

**Day 2**:
- Morning: Recover health, gather information properly
- Midday: Work for equipment money
- Afternoon: Purchase gear

**Day 3**:
- Morning-Midday: Mill route with proper preparation
- Afternoon: Deliver documents successfully

**Result**: Early failure teaches importance of preparation. Recovery time is available. Success through learning.

## Conversation System Integration

### Information Gathering Conversations

**Purpose**: Practical adventure support, not separate mini-game

**With Martha**:
- Use Rapport cards: Build trust for personal story
- Use Insight cards: Ask targeted questions about mill
- Use Diplomacy cards: Learn practical route details
- Goal: Reach momentum threshold for full story (mechanism danger, daughter disappearance, safe crossing location)

**With Elena**:
- Use Rapport cards: Show empathy for her urgency
- Use Authority cards: Assert competence as courier
- Use Insight cards: Clarify details about delivery
- Goal: Accept obligation with full understanding of challenge

**With Equipment Vendor**:
- Use Diplomacy cards: Negotiate prices or bundles
- Use Insight cards: Understand equipment capabilities
- Use Authority cards: Assert need for quality
- Goal: Purchase appropriate equipment for challenge ahead

### Conversation as Adventure Tool

**Not**: Separate tactical puzzle disconnected from world
**Instead**: Method of gathering information, building relationships, preparing for challenges

**Conversation outcomes provide**:
- Route knowledge (hidden paths, dangers, timing)
- Equipment needs (what tools required for specific challenges)
- Historical context (understanding locations and mysteries)
- Social connections (who to trust, who to suspect)
- Tactical advantages (observation cards from shared knowledge)

- Supports preparation strategy
- Never blocks progress permanently
- Makes planning rewarding

## Conclusion

This POC demonstrates the refined Wayfarer experience:

Obligations drive exploration of interesting locations with real challenges. Investigation presents active problem-solving requiring preparation, equipment, and careful choices. Travel offers genuine obstacles demanding knowledge and resources. Conversations gather information serving adventure goals.

The mill mystery layers physical danger (structural collapse), social risk (discovering secrets), and narrative depth (Martha's daughter) into single investigation. Success requires information gathering, proper equipment, stamina management, and good decision-making at each phase.

The creek vs mill choice presents meaningful trade-off: risk fast danger or take time for safer but more complex route. Weather deadline creates urgency without artificial pressure. Resource management serves adventure goals - coins buy needed rope and light, stamina enables climbing and mechanism work, time allows thorough investigation.

Player expression emerges through priorities: thorough investigation vs efficient delivery, safe preparation vs aggressive attempts, helping NPCs vs practical efficiency. Character revealed through choices under constraint.

The atmosphere comes from mechanics: dangerous structures, exposure risk, mystery requiring careful investigation, decisions with real consequences, preparation enabling success, failure teaching lessons.

Frieren-style slice-of-life adventure: small personal scale, grounded dangers, relationships through shared challenges, discovery as reward, no endgame just ongoing life as courier in world that doesn't revolve around you.

Time: 30-45 minutes for first playthrough. Teaches investigation structure, travel obstacles, resource management, conversation integration, preparation importance, and how systems serve adventure rather than competing for attention.
