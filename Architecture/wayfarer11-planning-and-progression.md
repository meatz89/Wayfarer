# Wayfarer Daily Planning and Progression System: Design Document

## 1. Introduction and Design Philosophy

The progression system for Wayfarer creates a deeply engaging gameplay loop centered around daily planning and resource management. Drawing inspiration from games like 'The Life and Suffering Of Sir Brante' but tailored to our authentic medieval setting, this system prioritizes player engagement through elegant, interwoven progression paths that feel natural rather than mechanical.

### Core Design Pillars

1. **Optimize Player Experience**: Create fun and motivation first, storytelling second
2. **Elegant Simplicity**: Maximize depth through simple, interconnected systems rather than complexity
3. **Verisimilitude**: Ensure mechanics and narrative feel authentic to the medieval setting
4. **Player Agency**: Allow meaningful choices with clear consequences that shape character development
5. **Multi-layered Rewards**: Design actions that efficiently advance multiple player goals simultaneously

### The Fundamental Engagement Loop

The heart of Wayfarer's progression system is the location spot leveling mechanic. Rather than traditional quest structures, the game uses repeatable actions at location spots that:

1. Provide immediate practical benefits (resources, skills, relationships)
2. Build progress toward "leveling up" the location spot
3. Trigger narrative encounters when spots level up
4. Unlock new actions, locations, and story branches
5. Connect to other locations' opportunities through organic narrative threads

This creates a system where optimization feels natural rather than gamified—the player follows interests and solves resource management challenges, which organically leads to discovering stories and opportunities that fit their playstyle.

## 2. Core Progression Mechanics

### Location Spot Leveling

The central progression mechanic replaces the traditional quest system with an organic location development approach:

- Each location spot (blacksmith's forge, village inn, forest creek) has repeatable basic actions
- Each action yields immediate benefits (coins, skills, resources) and location spot XP
- When a location spot gains enough XP, it "levels up"
- Level-ups trigger narrative encounters that advance mini-storylines
- These encounters unlock new actions, connections to other locations, and story developments
- Each location spot has its own "tech tree" of unlockable content revealed through engagement

### Resource Management

Player planning revolves around managing several limited resources:

1. **Time**: Divided into morning, afternoon, evening, and night
2. **Energy**: Expended by physical activities and travel
3. **Focus**: Required for intellectual activities
4. **Spirit**: Used in social interactions
5. **Health**: Maintained for survival and effectiveness
6. **Coin**: Earned and spent on goods and services

Resource management creates natural decision points without artificial constraints. The player must balance:
- Which location to visit when (as some actions are only available at specific times)
- How to efficiently restore depleted resources
- When to spend vs. save coins
- Which skills and relationships to develop

### Skills and Class System

The player's character class influences their starting skills and natural aptitudes:

1. **Artisan** - Excels in **Endurance**
2. **Courtier** - Excels in **Charm**
3. **Scribe** - Excels in **Knowledge**
4. **Courtier** - Excels in **Charisma**
5. **Shadow** - Excels in **Finesse**

Each skill:
- Improves through relevant actions
- Unlocks new action options when reaching thresholds
- Provides bonuses to success in encounters
- Gates access to certain locations and opportunities
- Influences available narrative choices

### Reputation and Relationships

Beyond mechanical resources, the player manages:

1. **Overall Reputation**: How the community collectively views the player
2. **Individual Relationships**: Connections with specific characters

These social values:
- Gate access to certain actions and locations
- Determine available dialogue options
- Influence outcomes of encounters
- Provide unique benefits when reaching thresholds
- Create narrative branches with long-term consequences

## 3. Daily Planning System

### Time Window Structure

Drawing inspiration from the Persona series but adapted to the medieval setting, the day is divided into four distinct time periods:

1. **Morning** (Dawn to Noon)
   - Primary work opportunities
   - Market activities

2. **Afternoon** (Noon to Sunset)
   - Continued work opportunities
   - Travel and exploration

3. **Evening** (Sunset to Midnight)
   - Rapport activities
   - Entertainment and relaxation
   - Information gathering

4. **Night** (Midnight to Dawn)
   - Rest and recovery
   - Clandestine activities

Each action consumes a specific time window, forcing meaningful choices about daily activities.

### Activity Scheduling

Unlike Sir Brante's rigid scheduling, Wayfarer uses a resource-based limitation system:

- Activities drain specific resource combinations (energy, focus, spirit)
- Time windows limit when specific actions are available
- Location accessibility creates travel considerations
- Natural cycles of depletion and restoration create rhythm

This approach maintains the addictive planning element of Sir Brante while feeling more organic to the medieval setting and allowing more flexible scheduling within constraints.

### Restoration Mechanics

Resource management creates natural planning considerations:

- **Energy**: Restored primarily through sleep and food
- **Focus**: Restored through relaxation and meaningful activity changes
- **Spirit**: Restored through successes and positive social interactions
- **Health**: Maintained through appropriate care and avoiding exhaustion

Different restoration methods have different efficiencies, costs, and time requirements, creating strategic decisions about how to recover resources.

## 4. Narrative Branching Through Location Progression

### Location Spot "Tech Trees"

Each location spot (blacksmith, tavern, creek, etc.) has its own progression path with:

1. **Base Actions**: Always available, yield reliable basic benefits
2. **Milestone Encounters**: Triggered when the spot levels up
3. **Unlockable Actions**: Become available after specific milestones
4. **Connected Locations**: Discovered through milestone encounters
5. **Character Relationships**: Developed through repeated interactions

### Organic Quest Structure

Rather than traditional quests, storylines develop through location spot progression:

1. Player performs base actions at a location for immediate benefits
2. Location spot gains XP and eventually levels up
3. Next visit triggers a milestone encounter introducing a new narrative element
4. New actions become available that advance this narrative thread
5. Milestone may reveal new locations, characters, or opportunities
6. Player can choose to pursue this thread or focus elsewhere

### Example Progression Path

Example: Blacksmith's Forge Location Spot

**Base Actions:**
- "Help with Metalwork" (Morning/Afternoon)
  - Costs: Energy -20, Focus -10
  - Yields: Coins +15, Endurance +2, Blacksmith Relationship +1

**Progression Path:**
1. **Level 1**: Initial access with basic work opportunity
2. **Level 2**: Milestone - Blacksmith seeks quality materials
   - Unlocks: "Discuss Metallurgy" action (Knowledge skill)
   - Unlocks: "Mine Location" if player has sufficient Charm skill
3. **Level 3**: Milestone - Blacksmith's relative seeks help
   - Unlocks: "Search for Daughter" action and new location
   - Develops: Character relationship with blacksmith's family

This approach replaces traditional quest structures with organic narrative development based on player engagement with locations.

## 5. Class-Specific Content Integration

### Village as Microcosm

The starting village serves as a complete representation of the game's systems where each class can find activities that leverage their skill advantages:

#### Artisan (Endurance)
- **Primary Location Spots**: Guard Post, Training Yard
- **Base Actions**: Train Militia, Patrol Village, Spar with Guards

### Universal Emotional Hooks

Every class path provides similar emotional engagement through:

1. **Romance**: Each class path has potential romantic interests
2. **Rivalry**: Class-appropriate competitors challenge the player
3. **Opportunity**: Paths to greater status within their discipline
4. **Risk**: Meaningful decisions with both rewards and consequences

### Systemic Integration Through Gating

Choices have consequences similar to "The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante":

- Specific choices explicitly close off other options
- Clear visibility of requirements for choices ("Requires Charm 3")
- Past decisions permanently shape available futures
- Resources spent on one path cannot be spent on another

## 6. AI Integration Approach

### Mechanical Core vs. Narrative Layer

The game separates its deterministic mechanical systems from AI-generated narrative:

1. **Developer-Created Mechanical Core**:
   - Location spot progression framework
   - Resource management systems
   - Skill advancement mechanics
   - Relationship and reputation tracking
   - Time window availability
   - Action costs and rewards

2. **AI-Generated Narrative Layer**:
   - Dialogue specific to player's situation and history
   - Environmental descriptions
   - Character reactions
   - Encounter specifics
   - Consequence narration

### Pre-Generated vs. Just-in-Time Content

The AI components are divided into those prepared in advance and those generated on demand:

#### Pre-Generated:
- **Character Templates**: Basic personality frameworks and relationship arcs
- **Narrative Frameworks**: General story structures for location progressions
- **Encounter Templates**: Pattern libraries for different encounter types
- **Dialogue Style Guides**: Character voice patterns for consistency
- **World Observation Foundation**: Core background elements

#### Just-in-Time Generated:
- **Specific Dialogue**: Words spoken based on current context
- **Contextual Descriptions**: Environmental narration referencing player history
- **Consequence Narration**: How the world reacts to player decisions
- **Relationship Developments**: Evolution of NPC attitudes
- **Encounter Specifics**: Details relevant to current situation

This hybrid approach maintains mechanical integrity while allowing the narrative to feel responsive and personalized without compromising the core game systems.

## 7. Example Gameplay Flow

### A Day in the Life

This example demonstrates the integrated progression system for a Artisan-class player:

**Morning:**
- Player chooses to work at the Blacksmith's Forge
- Spends Energy and Focus, gains Coins and relationship progress
- Forge gains XP toward next level
- Endurance skill increases slightly

**Afternoon:**
- Energy is getting low, so player visits the Guard Post
- "Train with Guards" costs less Energy than the forge
- Improves Endurance skill more significantly
- Guard Post gains XP toward next level

**Evening:**
- Player needs to restore Focus
- Visits the creek to relax (free, but slower restoration)
- Encounters NPC also at the creek
- Relationship with NPC improves
- Creek gains XP toward next level

**Night:**
- Player must choose between:
  - Paying for room at inn (costs Coins, fully restores Energy)
  - Camping outside (free, partially restores Energy)
- Choice depends on Coin reserves and next day's plans

**Next Day - Guard Post Levels Up:**
- When visiting Guard Post, a milestone encounter triggers
- Captain mentions travelers attacked on the road
- Unlocks new action "Investigate Attack Site"
- Creates opportunity to demonstrate Artisan skills
- Could lead to discovering bandit camp location

This flow shows how daily resource management naturally leads to narrative development through location progression.

## 8. Conclusion

The Wayfarer progression system creates an elegant, engaging gameplay loop that encourages strategic planning without sacrificing narrative immersion. By integrating location spot progression with resource management and class specialization, the game creates meaningful choices that advance both mechanical development and story simultaneously.

The village microcosm establishes the pattern that will extend throughout the game—organic narrative discovery driven by practical player choices, with clear consequences and multiple viable paths forward. This approach ensures that optimization feels natural rather than mechanical, creating an experience where players become deeply invested in their daily decisions and the long-term consequences they create.

By separating the deterministic mechanical core from the responsive narrative layer, the game maintains consistent systems while allowing the AI to provide personalized storytelling that adapts to each player's unique journey. This hybrid approach creates a game that feels both mechanically sound and narratively rich, with each element reinforcing rather than competing with the other.
