## 9. Action Resolution System

1. **Action Availability**: Determined by location, time of day, and properties
2. **Card Requirement**: Each action requires a specific card type (Physical, Intellectual, Social)
3. **Skill Check System**: 
   - Each action has 2-4 approaches
   - Each approach requires a specific skill check
   - Check Value = Skill Level + Card Bonus + Property Modifiers + Equipment Bonus
   - Check Requirement = Base Difficulty (1-10)
   - Player can select any approach where Check Value ≥ Requirement
4. **Outcome Determination**:
   - Each approach has a pre-defined outcome
   - Outcomes vary in reward type and quantity
   - Higher difficulty checks generally yield better rewards
5. **Card Exhaustion**:
   - The card used is exhausted after action resolution
   - Exhausted cards cannot be used until refreshed

## 10. Daily Deck Construction

1. **Morning Planning**:
   - Player has X Action Points (usually 4-6)
   - Player can include up to X cards in daily deck
   - Physical cards require Energy equal to their level
   - Intellectual cards require Concentration equal to their level
   - Social cards require no resources to include
   - Player selects exactly which cards to include

2. **Card Availability**:
   - Player can only include cards for skills they have trained
   - Player can only include cards that aren't exhausted
   - Player must have sufficient resources to include the card

3. **Deck Optimization Strategies**:
   - Balance card types based on anticipated actions
   - Prioritize higher level cards for important skills
   - Include cards with tags matching expected locations
   - Consider refreshment strategies for multi-day planning

This system creates elegant mechanical depth without unnecessary complexity. Every card directly represents a character skill, creating a natural connection between character development and daily capabilities. The tag system allows for contextual bonuses without requiring special-case rules.

The constraints of Energy, Concentration, and Action Points create meaningful daily planning decisions, while the exhaustion system prevents action spamming while feeling authentic to a medieval life simulation.
