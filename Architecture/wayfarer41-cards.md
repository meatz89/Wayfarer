These cards provide a foundation of universally applicable capabilities across all skill types. The names and tags reflect the specific strengths and environments where each card is most effective. Each card can be used for any action requiring its type (Physical, Intellectual, Social), but will provide additional advantages when used in environments matching its tags.

For example, "Persistent Labor" (+1 Strength) functions anywhere but performs especially well for interior crafting tasks that require thorough attention, while "Friendly Demeanor" (+1 Charm) is particularly effective in crowded commercial settings where a bold approach is beneficial.

This tagging system creates meaningful differentiation between cards of the same skill, allowing for strategic deck construction without requiring overly complex card effects or combinations.
