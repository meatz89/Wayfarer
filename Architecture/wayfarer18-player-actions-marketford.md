Player Actions in Marketford: A Design Framework (Excluding Crafting & Trade)
1. Introduction
Purpose: This report outlines a comprehensive suite of specific player actions tailored for the Marketford game setting, deliberately excluding crafting and trade systems to focus on social interaction, investigation, personal development, and civic engagement. The objective is to define actions consistent with the game's established mechanics: a tight action economy constrained by Location Spots and Time Windows, utilizing core Skills (Endurance, Finesse, Diplomacy, Charm, Insight, Lore) and Resources (Energy, Time, Money, Health, Focus, Spirit, Items, Knowledge).

Methodology: The proposed actions are derived from an analysis of historical research concerning the function and daily life within medieval European market towns. This grounding ensures thematic consistency and plausible interactions within the game world. Emphasis is placed on creating meaningful choices and consequences tied directly to resource management, reflecting the challenges and opportunities of the setting.

Context: Marketford is envisioned as a setting drawing inspiration from historical medieval European market towns, characterized by specific social and physical structures. Key characteristics influencing the design of these actions include the central market square as both an economic and social hub , the crucial role of inns and taverns for travelers and locals alike , the realities of medieval travel and its associated risks and limitations , the methods of information dissemination in a society with limited literacy, such as notice boards and town criers , and the nature of civic organization, including rudimentary law enforcement and citizen duties. These elements form the backdrop against which player actions will occur, providing context and constraints.   

2. Core Social Actions
These actions focus on navigating the social landscape of Marketford, interacting with its inhabitants, managing relationships, and engaging with the town's social structures.

2.1. Gather Information/Gossip
Acquiring knowledge through social interaction is vital in Marketford. Actions involve listening, asking questions, or subtly prompting Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in social hubs to gain local news, rumors, quest hooks, or information about specific individuals or events. Success requires navigating social nuances and understanding the environment. Key locations for these actions include the Tavern Common Room, the Inn Courtyard, the Market Square (particularly during market hours when social interaction is high ), the Church Steps (e.g., after services), and potentially Guild Halls during specific times.   

The nature of information available may differ based on the location. Inns often catered to wealthier travelers, merchants, and officials, potentially offering news related to trade routes, regional politics, or high-status individuals. Conversely, taverns and alehouses served a more local clientele and might be sources for personal gossip, local disputes, worker grievances, or even seditious talk. This distinction allows players to strategically choose locations based on their information needs.   

Gathering information is not a passive activity but an expenditure of valuable resources within Marketford's tight action economy. It consumes Time and mental effort (Focus) and carries social risks. Being perceived as overly inquisitive or clumsy in approach can damage relationships or raise suspicion, making success dependent on Skill checks and careful execution.

Action Example: Listen In

Description: Passively attempting to overhear conversations in a crowded social setting.
Requirements: Presence at a suitable Location Spot (e.g., Tavern Common Room) during an active Time Window (e.g., Evening).
Costs: Time (e.g., 1 Time Window slot), Energy (minor), Focus (moderate, to filter noise and identify relevant information). May require purchasing a drink (Money cost) to blend in.
Skills: Primarily Insight (to discern truthfulness, relevance, and subtle meanings), potentially Charm (to appear inconspicuous and non-threatening). Low skill may result in misunderstanding, acquiring false rumors, or gaining useless information.
Yields: Knowledge (specific rumors, NPC schedules/habits, local sentiment, potential opportunities or threats), XP (minor), potential minor negative Relationship changes if noticed eavesdropping.
Action Example: Inquire Casually

Description: Directly but subtly asking an NPC for information.
Requirements: Target NPC present, minimum Relationship threshold (e.g., Neutral or higher to avoid immediate suspicion).
Costs: Time (part of a Time Window), Energy (minor), Focus (minor).
Skills: Primarily Charm (to phrase questions naturally and disarmingly), potentially Diplomacy (for more formal or sensitive inquiries). Failure might lower the Relationship, make the NPC wary, or result in deliberate misinformation.
Yields: Knowledge (direct answers, potentially biased or incomplete), XP (minor), Relationship changes (positive if handled well and the NPC is helpful, negative if clumsy, offensive, or asking about sensitive topics).
2.2. Build/Damage Relationships
Players can intentionally take actions to cultivate positive relationships or deliberately undermine others within Marketford's social fabric. This involves interacting directly with specific NPCs or influencing perceptions within factions like guilds, the church, or the town watch. Actions can range from helpful gestures to malicious rumor-mongering. Locations vary depending on the specific action and target NPC (e.g., their home, workplace, a public square, or tavern).

Medieval towns often fostered close-knit communities where actions towards one individual could have wider repercussions. Therefore, relationship mechanics should reflect this interconnectedness. Successfully performing a favor for a guild member might improve standing with the entire guild, while spreading damaging rumors about someone could alienate their friends, family, or allies, adding strategic depth to social maneuvering.   

Action Example: Offer a Small Favor

Description: Assisting an NPC with a minor task or need.
Requirements: Identify an NPC's need (through observation or conversation), possess the necessary Item, Skill, or Resource. A minimum Relationship threshold may apply.
Costs: Time (variable, depending on the favor), Energy (variable), potentially Items (e.g., providing food) or Money (e.g., covering a small debt).
Skills: Diplomacy or Charm (to offer help appropriately without causing offense or seeming patronizing), potentially other Skills depending on the favor (e.g., Endurance for physical labor, Lore for providing specific information).
Yields: Significant positive Relationship change with the target NPC, XP (moderate), potentially Knowledge of a reciprocal obligation or gratitude that can be leveraged later.
Action Example: Spread Rumor

Description: Intentionally disseminating gossip (true or false) about an NPC or group to damage their reputation or relationships.
Requirements: Possess specific Knowledge (the rumor), identify a target NPC or group to spread it to.
Costs: Time (part of a Time Window), Focus (moderate, to be convincing and subtle), potential minor Spirit cost if the action is malicious or goes against the player character's nature.
Skills: Charm (to spread the rumor subtly and believably, perhaps disguised as innocent gossip), potentially Finesse (to avoid being easily identified as the source, especially if the rumor is damaging or false). Failure could damage the player's own Relationship with the listener or their general Reputation if caught lying or being malicious. Warnings against informing on gangsters suggest potential physical risks as well.   
Yields: Decrease in the target's Relationship with the listener (and potentially others who hear the rumor), potential creation of chaos, distraction, or mistrust; XP (minor), potential negative change to the player's own Reputation.
2.3. Formal Interactions
Engaging with figures of authority or established institutions (Town Council, Guild Leadership, Lord's representatives, Church hierarchy) requires navigating official channels and protocols. These interactions often occur in specific locations like the Town Hall, Guild Hall, the Lord's Manor or Castle Keep, or the Church Office, and may be restricted to certain Time Windows (e.g., office hours, scheduled meeting times).

Access to and success in these formal interactions are often heavily influenced by the player character's social standing, reputation, and existing relationships, reflecting the hierarchical nature of medieval society. Characters with low status or poor reputation may face significant barriers, require intermediaries, or need to expend considerable resources (including bribes) to gain an audience or have their requests considered. This reinforces the importance of building social capital through other actions. Formal interactions often involve dealing with specific legal rights, charters, or permissions granted by authorities.   

Action Example: Petition an Official

Description: Making a formal request or plea to a town official, guild master, or other authority figure.
Requirements: A specific goal or request, potentially required documents (Knowledge or Item), a minimum Reputation or Relationship level with the official or their faction, potentially securing an appointment (which might require a prior action).
Costs: Time (significant, potentially spanning multiple Time Windows for appointments and the meeting itself), Energy (minor), Focus (high, for careful negotiation and presentation), potentially Money (as an official fee, a bribe, or a customary gift) or Items (as gifts).
Skills: Primarily Diplomacy (for formal negotiation, clear articulation of the request, and persuasive arguments), potentially Lore (to understand relevant procedures, laws , or precedents), Insight (to read the official's mood, intentions, and potential biases).   
Yields: Potential success (permission granted, request fulfilled, problem addressed), Knowledge (about official procedures, the political landscape, the official's priorities), Relationship change (with the official and potentially their faction), XP (moderate to high depending on complexity and success). Failure can result in refusal, imposition of penalties, negative Relationship changes, or damage to Reputation.
Action Example: Attend Guild Meeting

Description: Participating in a scheduled meeting of a guild the player belongs to or has been invited to observe. Guilds had their own regulations and assemblies.   
Requirements: Guild membership or an official invitation. Occurs during a specific Time Window.
Costs: Time (1-2 Time Windows), Energy (minor), Focus (moderate, to follow discussions and politics).
Skills: Diplomacy (to participate effectively in discussions, propose motions, or argue points), Insight (to understand underlying currents, alliances, rivalries, and unspoken agendas), Lore (knowledge of guild rules, history, and traditions).
Yields: Knowledge (about guild business, upcoming opportunities, internal conflicts, member statuses), Relationship changes (with other guild members based on participation), XP (moderate), potential voting rights or increased influence within the guild hierarchy (if applicable).
2.4. Attend Public Events
Marketford's calendar is marked by various public gatherings. Participating in or observing these events—such as seasonal festivals, market fairs , religious services , public announcements by town criers , or even grim spectacles like executions —offers unique opportunities and insights. These events typically occur in central locations like the Market Square, the Church, the Town Green, or near the town gallows, and are tied to specific dates or Time Windows.   

Attending public events provides concentrated opportunities for multiple yields (improving Spirit, altering Relationships, gaining Knowledge) but consumes significant Time, often spanning multiple Time Windows. This forces players to make strategic choices within the tight action economy, weighing the benefits of participation against other pressing tasks. These events also serve as important narrative beats, reflecting the town's cultural life, religious observances, and seasonal rhythms , making the game world feel more alive.   

Action Example: Attend Festival

Description: Participating in a town festival, fair, or celebration. Fairs were highlights of the year, attracting visitors and featuring entertainments.   
Requirements: Event must be active (specific Time Window/Date).
Costs: Time (potentially multiple Time Windows), Energy (moderate, due to activity and crowds), potentially Money (for food, drinks, games, or souvenirs like pilgrimage badges ).   
Skills: Charm (for socializing and mingling effectively), Finesse (for participating in games or competitions), Insight (for observing interactions, identifying key figures, or noticing subtle events within the crowd).
Yields: Spirit increase (temporary boost from enjoyment and community), Relationship changes (opportunities to interact with many NPCs), Knowledge (local customs, current mood of the populace, potential opportunities or rumors picked up), XP (moderate), potentially Items (prizes won in games, unique festival goods).
Action Example: Witness Proclamation/Execution

Description: Observing an official announcement delivered by a town crier  or attending a public execution.   
Requirements: Event must be active (specific Time Window/Date).
Costs: Time (1 Time Window), Focus (moderate, to absorb details and observe the crowd).
Skills: Insight (to gauge public reaction, identify key figures present, understand the underlying message or warning), Lore (to understand the legal or political context of the proclamation or execution).
Yields: Knowledge (new laws, official decrees, warnings, public sentiment towards authority or the condemned), XP (minor), potentially a decrease in Spirit depending on the nature of the event (especially executions).
3. Exploration & Investigation Actions
These actions involve interacting with the physical environment of Marketford, uncovering hidden information, observing routines, and pursuing leads without necessarily engaging in direct social interaction.

3.1. Scout Location
This action involves carefully observing a specific Location Spot to understand its physical layout, typical activity patterns, security measures (like guard patrols or locked doors), potential points of interest, or NPC routines, all without drawing attention. This is crucial in a setting where dangers like crime and banditry exist. Effective scouting can be done at any defined Location Spot (e.g., an Alleyway, Warehouse Exterior, Guard Post, Market Stall Area), but the timing (Time Window) can be critical – scouting a guard post might yield different information at night versus during the day.   

The Knowledge gained from scouting serves as a valuable precursor for other actions. Knowing a guard's patrol route, the location of a blind spot, or the existence of a hidden entrance can significantly improve the chances of success for subsequent Stealth actions, or even enable entirely new approaches to a situation. This creates preparatory gameplay loops, rewarding players who invest time in planning and observation before acting.

Action Example: Scout Location
Requirements: Physical access to the Location Spot.
Costs: Time (1 Time Window), Energy (minor), Focus (high, requires concentration to notice details). Involves a risk of being detected if the character is careless or chooses a poor vantage point.
Skills: Primarily Insight (to notice subtle details, identify patterns in movement or behavior, spot security weaknesses), potentially Finesse (to remain inconspicuous while observing). Low Insight yields only obvious information or fails to spot crucial details.
Yields: Knowledge (recorded as detailed map notes, documented NPC patrol routes, identified security flaws like weak doors or unobserved areas, noted hidden entrances or potential item locations, potential ambush spots), XP (moderate).
3.2. Search Area
Unlike passive scouting, searching involves actively and physically examining a specific, limited area within a Location Spot. The goal is to find hidden objects, clues, documents, money stashes, or other concealed items. This action is more intrusive and carries a higher risk of detection than scouting. Examples include searching under a loose floorboard, inside a crate, among the books on a shelf in an office, or through a pile of refuse in an alley.

The effectiveness and yield of searching can be enhanced by prior knowledge. A general, speculative search might yield minor, random items or nothing at all. However, searching a specific location based on a clue or rumor gained previously (Knowledge) could have a significantly higher chance of yielding a relevant plot item, document, or valuable discovery. This mechanism rewards players for following leads and makes the investigation process feel more coherent and directed.

Action Example: Search Area
Requirements: Access to the specific search spot (e.g., a particular container, piece of furniture, or section of a room). Often requires privacy or successful use of stealth to avoid being observed.
Costs: Time (part of a Time Window), Energy (minor), Focus (moderate). Carries a higher risk of detection than scouting due to physical interaction with the environment.
Skills: Primarily Insight (to notice irregularities suggesting concealment, like a loose stone or a false bottom), potentially Lore (if searching for specific types of documents, symbols, or historical artifacts), Finesse (to search quickly and without leaving obvious traces).
Yields: Items (found objects, money stash, tools, keys), Knowledge (clues like letters, maps, diary entries, incriminating evidence), XP (moderate). Failure might mean finding nothing, triggering a trap, making noise that attracts attention, or leaving evidence of the search.
3.3. Follow/Observe Target
This action involves discreetly tailing an NPC or monitoring their activities from a distance over a period of time. The objective is to learn their destination, identify their contacts, observe their behavior in different situations, or discover variations in their routine. This is a dynamic action, potentially requiring the player to follow the target through multiple Location Spots, navigating Marketford's potentially crowded and narrow streets and alleys.   

Successful observation yields more than just tracking data ("Target went from A to B"). A high level of Insight allows for interpretation of the observed behavior, providing richer Knowledge. For example, instead of just noting "Target met Person X," a successful Insight check might yield "Target met Person X, appeared nervous during the exchange, and quickly concealed a small package received." This adds layers to the gathered intelligence, making it more narratively engaging and potentially more actionable for the player.

Action Example: Follow/Observe Target
Requirements: Target NPC must be in sight at the start of the action.
Costs: Time (variable, depending on how long the target is followed), Energy (moderate, due to constant movement and potential need for quick adjustments), Focus (high, requires continuous attention to maintain sight, appropriate distance, and remain hidden), potential Spirit decrease due to stress or boredom during long tails. Carries a high risk of detection if the target is wary or the player is clumsy.
Skills: Primarily Finesse (for staying hidden, moving quietly through potentially crowded areas, using cover effectively), Insight (for predicting the target's likely movements, anticipating turns, noticing signs of being detected), Endurance (may be required for very long pursuits or keeping up with a fast-moving target). Requires successive Skill checks as the situation changes.
Yields: Knowledge (target's destination, identity of meeting partners, details of interactions, variations from known routine), XP (moderate to high depending on duration, difficulty, and information gained). Being detected typically leads to the target attempting to evade, confronting the player, or raising an alarm.
3.4. Consult Information Sources
Beyond gossip and observation, players can seek out more formal repositories of recorded knowledge or consult with recognized experts. Potential locations include Church Archives, Guild Records Rooms, a local Scholar's Study, Town Hall Records, or the home of a knowledgeable elder. Access may require permission, specific faction standing, or be limited to certain Time Windows.

Information obtained from these sources may not always be complete, accurate, or unbiased. Historical records can be flawed, incomplete, or written with a specific agenda. Experts, similarly, might have personal biases, limited knowledge, or reasons to mislead. Therefore, while a successful Lore check might determine if relevant information is found, a subsequent Insight check could be crucial for assessing its reliability, uncovering hidden meanings, identifying omissions, or detecting the expert's potential agenda. This adds a layer of critical evaluation to the research process, preventing it from being a simple matter of accessing objective facts.

Action Example: Research Archives

Description: Searching through documented records for specific information.
Requirements: Permission or access to the archive location (may require a successful Relationship check, Diplomacy check, bribe, or specific faction standing), a defined topic or question for research (Knowledge).
Costs: Time (significant, potentially multiple Time Windows for thorough research), Focus (high, requires concentration and sifting through potentially large amounts of text), potentially Money (as an access fee or donation).
Skills: Primarily Lore (to navigate the archive system, understand the language/script, identify relevant documents), Insight (to pick out key passages, interpret ambiguous text, notice inconsistencies or potential hidden meanings).
Yields: Knowledge (historical facts, legal precedents, genealogies, records of specific past events, maps, guild secrets), XP (moderate). Failure might mean finding no relevant information, misinterpreting the data found, or overlooking crucial details.
Action Example: Seek Expert Opinion

Description: Consulting an NPC known for their expertise in a particular field (e.g., history, local lore, medicine, law).
Requirements: Identify and locate the relevant expert NPC, establish a minimum Relationship or Reputation level to be granted an audience, have a clear question or topic for consultation.
Costs: Time (1 Time Window for the consultation), Focus (moderate, to ask pertinent questions and absorb the information), potentially Money (as a consultation fee) or an Item (as a gift or payment).
Skills: Diplomacy (to frame the request respectfully and clearly), Lore (to understand the expert's field and terminology, ask informed questions), Insight (to judge the expert's honesty, potential biases, confidence in their own knowledge).
Yields: Knowledge (expert analysis, specific answers, new perspectives or theories, potential leads for further investigation), Relationship change (with the expert), XP (moderate). The expert might refuse to help, provide incomplete information, or even deliberately mislead if suspicious or ill-disposed towards the player.
4. Personal Management & Development Actions
These actions focus on maintaining the player character's well-being, improving their Skills, and managing their status within Marketford society.

4.1. Rest & Recovery
Characters need to manage their personal Resources like Energy, Health, Focus, and Spirit. Actions under this category are taken specifically to restore these depleted resources. Options range from renting a room at an inn , using the player's own dwelling (if available), finding a quiet corner in a tavern (offering limited recovery), seeking solace in a church for spiritual recovery , or resting in a secluded spot outside town (which carries risks).   

The quality of rest significantly impacts resource recovery rates. A private, locked room in a well-maintained inn  will offer far better restoration of Energy, Health, and Focus than a noisy, communal sleeping chamber  or sleeping rough outdoors. This makes the choice of where to rest a meaningful economic and strategic decision, forcing players to balance the cost (Time, Money) against the desired recovery and potential risks, especially given Marketford's tight economy. Resting in unsafe locations (like an alley or outside town walls) could even trigger negative events or encounters.   

Action Example: Sleep at Inn

Description: Paying for lodging at an inn to rest and recover.
Requirements: Sufficient Money to pay for the room. Presence at an Inn Location Spot.
Costs: Time (typically an 8-hour block or an overnight Time Window), Money (variable based on the quality of the room – communal vs. private).
Skills: None typically required, although a character with very low Endurance might recover less effectively even in good conditions.
Yields: Significant Energy restoration, minor natural Health recovery, moderate Focus restoration. Poor quality lodging yields less restoration and might impose fatigue penalties. High-quality lodging provides optimal recovery but costs more Money.
Action Example: Pray/Meditate

Description: Spending time in quiet contemplation or prayer to restore mental and spiritual well-being.
Requirements: A suitable Location Spot (e.g., Church, shrine, quiet natural setting).
Costs: Time (1 Time Window), Focus (moderate).
Skills: None required, but the effectiveness might be modified by the character's relationship with religious factions, specific character traits (e.g., 'Pious', 'Skeptical'), or the sanctity of the location.
Yields: Moderate to significant Spirit restoration, minor Focus restoration.
4.2. Skill Practice/Training
Characters can undertake dedicated actions to improve their Skills through practice, study, or mentorship. Suitable locations might include a designated Training Yard (for Endurance and Finesse), a Library or Scriptorium (for Lore), a Mentor's Workshop or Home (for various skills), or simply a Quiet Room (for practicing mental disciplines like Focus or Insight).

Skill training should be an engaging process rather than a passive time sink. Simply spending Time should not guarantee improvement. Success could depend on Focus checks, require specific resources (like rare books for Lore, training dummies for Finesse, or sparring partners), involve diminishing returns as skill increases, or incorporate mini-challenges or tests related to the skill. Seeking mentorship from an NPC adds a social dimension, potentially offering faster or unique skill gains but requiring a strong relationship and ongoing investment (Time, Money/gifts). This approach makes skill development interactive and integrated with other game systems. Guilds might also play a role in training or providing access to mentors.   

Action Example: Practice Combat Drills

Description: Engaging in physical exercises or weapon practice to improve combat-related skills. Citizen militias often engaged in regular drills.   
Requirements: Access to a suitable Training Yard or open space, potentially basic equipment (Item like a practice sword).
Costs: Time (1-2 Time Windows), Energy (high), Focus (moderate, for concentration on technique), potentially Money (fee for using facilities or hiring a trainer).
Skills: Targets Endurance (for stamina and resilience drills) or Finesse (for agility, weapon handling, or sparring practice) for improvement. Success in gaining XP might depend on maintaining sufficient Focus throughout the session.
Yields: Skill XP towards the next level in the targeted Skill (Endurance or Finesse), minor main character XP. Potential for minor Health loss due to strain or minor injuries during practice.
Action Example: Study Texts

Description: Reading books, scrolls, or documents to improve knowledge-based skills. Booksellers were often found near cathedrals and schools.   
Requirements: Access to relevant texts (Location like a Library, or owned Item), potentially a minimum Lore skill to comprehend complex material, literacy.
Costs: Time (1-2 Time Windows), Focus (high, requires sustained concentration), potentially Money (access fee for a library or cost of acquiring texts).
Skills: Targets Lore (for absorbing historical, technical, or factual information) or Insight (for studying texts on philosophy, psychology, or interpretation) for improvement.
Yields: Skill XP towards the next level in the targeted Skill (Lore or Insight), minor main character XP, potentially acquisition of new specific Knowledge detailed in the texts.
Action Example: Seek Mentorship

Description: Learning directly from an NPC expert in a particular skill. Journeymen often traveled to learn from different masters.   
Requirements: Identify a willing Mentor NPC, achieve a high Relationship level, potentially complete an introductory task or demonstrate aptitude.
Costs: Time (variable, often involves scheduled sessions over a period), Money (payment, gifts, or covering mentor's expenses), Focus (high during training sessions).
Skills: Targets the specific Skill the mentor teaches.
Yields: Skill XP (potentially at a higher rate than solo practice), moderate main character XP, improved Relationship with the Mentor, potentially unique techniques or specialized Knowledge passed down by the mentor.
4.3. Seek Specialized Services (Non-Craft/Trade)
Players can engage NPCs who offer specific services related to personal well-being, information access, or other needs, excluding item crafting or direct buying/selling of goods. Examples include visiting a Physician for healing , seeking spiritual aid from the Church , hiring a Scribe for reading/writing tasks , consulting an Interpreter, or using a Bathhouse.   

The availability and quality of these services might fluctuate based on Marketford's size, prosperity, and current circumstances. For instance, a physician might be overwhelmed and less effective during an outbreak of disease , or a particular service might only be available in larger, wealthier towns. Access could also be gated by the player's Reputation or standing with relevant factions (e.g., needing good standing with the Church to receive certain blessings). This dynamism adds another layer of strategic planning and resource management.   

Action Example: Visit Physician

Description: Seeking medical treatment for injuries or illnesses. Medieval medicine could be rudimentary and sometimes dangerous.   
Requirements: Locate the Physician's house or clinic, have sufficient Money to pay for treatment.
Costs: Time (1 Time Window for consultation/treatment), Money (potentially significant, depending on the ailment and treatment), possibility of temporary negative side effects from harsh treatments (e.g., reduced Energy, temporary stat penalties).
Skills: Diplomacy (to clearly explain symptoms and history), Insight (to try and judge the physician's competence, confidence, or the potential risks of the proposed treatment).
Yields: Health restoration (potentially faster or more complete than natural healing), removal of specific negative Health conditions (diseases, poisons, persistent injuries), Knowledge (about the ailment, its treatment, or preventative measures). There is a risk of incorrect diagnosis, ineffective treatment, or actively harmful procedures.
Action Example: Seek Blessing/Absolution

Description: Seeking spiritual aid from a priest or at a shrine for healing, purification, or peace of mind.
Requirements: Locate a Priest, Church, or Shrine, potentially require a minimum Relationship with the Church faction or make a suitable donation.
Costs: Time (part of a Time Window), Money (donation usually expected), Focus (moderate, for prayer or confession).
Skills: Diplomacy (for confession, making the request respectfully).
Yields: Significant Spirit restoration, removal of specific negative Spirit conditions (like curses, guilt, spiritual malaise), potentially a temporary positive status effect ('Blessed', 'Absolved'), positive Relationship change with the Church faction.
Action Example: Hire Scribe/Interpreter

Description: Employing someone literate to read, write, or translate documents, or to facilitate communication across language barriers.
Requirements: Locate a Scribe or Interpreter (perhaps via a stall near the market or church), have the document or communication need, sufficient Money.
Costs: Time (variable, depending on the length and complexity of the task), Money (fee based on the work).
Skills: Diplomacy (to negotiate terms and convey instructions clearly).
Yields: Knowledge (translated text, a newly written document, understanding of a foreign conversation), minor XP.
4.4. Manage Reputation
Reputation, distinct from individual relationships, reflects how the player character is generally perceived by the community or specific factions. These actions are undertaken specifically to influence this broader perception. Good reputation was important, and hospitality, for example, could impact it. Locations for reputation-influencing actions are often public spaces like the Market Square or Church, or institutional settings like the Town Hall or Guild Hall.   

Reputation can function as a tangible status or resource within the game, potentially gating access to certain interactions (e.g., invitations to exclusive gatherings), quests, information sources, or even physical Location Spots. It might decay slowly over time if not actively maintained, or be damaged swiftly by criminal acts, public failures, or social blunders. Managing reputation thus becomes an ongoing concern, integral to navigating Marketford's society effectively, reflecting the importance of social standing in the medieval period.   

Action Example: Public Donation/Charity

Description: Making a significant contribution of Money or valuable Items to a public cause or institution like the Church or an almshouse. Christian generosity was valued.   
Requirements: Access to the relevant institution, significant Money or valuable Items to donate.
Costs: Time (part of a Time Window), Money or Items (high value).
Skills: Diplomacy or Charm (to make the donation known publicly, if desired, without appearing overly boastful or performative).
Yields: Positive Reputation increase (general community perception or specific faction standing, e.g., with the Church), minor XP, potential positive Relationship changes with onlookers or direct beneficiaries.
Action Example: Perform Notable Public Deed

Description: Successfully intervening in a public crisis or performing an act of heroism or significant civic contribution when an opportunity arises (e.g., stopping a public brawl, rescuing someone from danger, exposing a major threat).
Requirements: An opportunity must present itself within the game world. Requires successful execution of relevant skills under pressure.
Costs: Variable, depending on the situation (potentially high Energy expenditure, risk to Health, significant Time commitment).
Skills: Varies widely depending on the deed (e.g., Finesse or Endurance for physical intervention, Diplomacy for de-escalation, Insight to assess the situation quickly, Lore if specialized knowledge is needed).
Yields: Significant Reputation increase (potentially achieving 'Heroic' or 'Respected' status), high XP, significant positive Relationship changes with those helped or who witnessed the deed.
Action Example: Boast/Spread Tales of Deeds

Description: Recounting one's own accomplishments in a social setting like a tavern to enhance personal renown. Travelers brought back tales, and storytellers were popular.   
Requirements: Have actually performed a notable deed (specific Knowledge flag), be in a suitable social setting (e.g., Tavern Common Room).
Costs: Time (part of a Time Window), Focus (minor), potentially Money (e.g., buying a round of drinks to gain an audience).
Skills: Charm (to boast effectively, entertainingly, and believably, without sounding arrogant or dishonest). Failure can lead to ridicule, disbelief, and potentially a negative Reputation change ('Boaster', 'Liar').
Yields: Potential minor Reputation increase if the story is well-received and believed, minor XP.
5. Civic & Security Actions
These actions involve interacting with Marketford's systems of law and order, navigating security measures, and utilizing public information channels.

5.1. Report Findings/Crimes
Players who uncover evidence of crimes, conspiracies, or other significant threats can choose to report this information to the relevant authorities. This might involve contacting the town guard or watch , a specific town official like a bailiff or constable , or a representative of the local lord. Appropriate locations include a Guard Post, the Town Hall, or an Official's Office.   

The outcome of reporting information can depend heavily on the nature of the authority figure receiving it. Reporting to a known corrupt official  might lead to the information being suppressed, used against the player, or even result in danger for the player. Conversely, reporting to a diligent but perhaps under-resourced citizen watch  might earn gratitude and a positive reputation boost but result in little effective action being taken. This requires players to use Insight or gather prior Knowledge about the integrity and competence of individual officials or guard units, adding a strategic layer to sharing sensitive information. There's also the inherent risk of reprisal from those being reported, as warnings from gangsters on notice boards suggest.   

Action Example: Report Findings/Crimes
Requirements: Possess relevant Knowledge (details of a crime witnessed, evidence of a conspiracy, location of contraband), locate an appropriate authority figure.
Costs: Time (part of a Time Window), Focus (moderate, to present the information clearly and coherently). Carries a potential risk of future reprisal from implicated parties.
Skills: Diplomacy (to present the information effectively, convincingly, and be taken seriously), Insight (to gauge the authority figure's reaction, determine if they are truly listening or potentially dismissive/corrupt).
Yields: Potential reward (Money, Item, official commendation), positive Reputation change (seen as law-abiding or helpful to authorities), positive Relationship change (with the specific official), moderate XP, potential initiation of an official investigation or action by NPCs based on the information provided. Authorities might dismiss the report if the player has a poor Reputation, lacks evidence, or fails relevant Skill checks.
5.2. Perform Civic Duty
Citizens in medieval towns often had obligations related to the community's upkeep and security. Players might participate in mandatory activities (like serving on the town watch rotation) or volunteer for tasks benefiting the town. Locations include the Town Walls or Gatehouse for watch duty, or Public Works Sites (e.g., helping repair walls, cleaning communal wells ).   

Performing these duties can be a significant way for characters, particularly those starting with low status or few resources, to gain Reputation, build relationships within the community, and become more integrated into Marketford society. It offers a path to social advancement based on participation and contribution rather than solely on wealth or combat prowess. Conversely, failing to perform mandatory duties (if applicable based on citizenship status) could result in fines, loss of Reputation, or other penalties imposed by town authorities.

Action Example: Serve on Watch Duty

Description: Participating in the town watch, patrolling streets or manning walls/gates. This was often a rotating duty for eligible citizens.   
Requirements: May require Citizen status or be a voluntary option. Adherence to a schedule or sign-up process. Basic equipment might be provided or required.
Costs: Time (significant, often a full night or day Time Window), Energy (moderate, from patrolling or standing guard), Focus (low, primarily passive observation unless an event occurs).
Skills: Endurance (to stay alert and withstand boredom or weather), Insight (to spot potential trouble, notice suspicious activity), potentially Diplomacy or Charm (for interacting with fellow watch members or dealing with minor public disturbances).
Yields: Positive Reputation increase ('Civic-Minded', 'Reliable'), Relationship changes (building camaraderie with fellow watch members, potentially positive interactions with guard captains or officials), minor XP (unless a significant event occurs during the watch, which would yield more), potentially Knowledge (observing unusual events, learning guard routines or security weaknesses from the inside). Fulfills civic obligation, avoiding potential penalties for shirking duty.
Action Example: Contribute to Public Works

Description: Volunteering labor for community projects like repairing fortifications, cleaning wells , clearing roads, or assisting after a disaster.   
Requirements: An active need or call for volunteers within the game world.
Costs: Time (variable, depending on the task), Energy (high, involves physical labor), potentially minor Health risk (accidents).
Skills: Primarily Endurance. Specific tasks might benefit from other skills tangentially.
Yields: Positive Reputation increase (seen as contributing to the community), positive Relationship changes (with fellow workers and potentially town leadership), minor XP, tangible benefit to the town (potentially reflected in the game state, e.g., improved defenses, cleaner water).
5.3. Bypass Security/Stealth
These actions involve attempts to move unseen, avoid detection by guards or citizens, or overcome physical security measures like locked doors or containers (specifically those not related to active trade inventories, to adhere to the exclusion of trade systems). Stealth might be necessary to access restricted areas, retrieve items, plant evidence, or conduct observations without alerting others. Relevant locations include guarded areas (like warehouses or official buildings), private residences (especially at night), dark alleys, or even rooftops.

The success of stealth actions should be heavily influenced by dynamic environmental factors. Light levels (time of day, weather), ambient noise, available cover, and the alertness state of nearby NPCs are crucial. This ties stealth gameplay directly into Marketford's Time Window system and environmental simulation. Effective stealth often relies on prior observation and planning, making the Scout Location action a valuable precursor. Success requires careful timing and skillful use of the environment, making stealth a tactical challenge rather than just a passive skill check against a static difficulty.

Action Example: Sneak Past Guards

Description: Attempting to move through an area monitored by guards or watchmen without being detected.
Requirements: Guards present, a suitable environment offering shadows, cover, or distractions.
Costs: Time (variable, usually involves slower movement), Energy (minor), Focus (high, requires constant awareness and careful movement). Carries a high risk of detection.
Skills: Primarily Finesse (for moving quietly, utilizing cover, climbing, or balancing), Insight (for timing movements based on guard patrols, noticing changes in guard awareness, spotting potential hazards). Requires successive checks based on distance covered, complexity of the environment, and proximity to guards.
Yields: Successful access to a restricted area, avoidance of confrontation or alarm, moderate XP. Detection typically leads to an alarm being raised, pursuit, and potential combat or arrest.
Action Example: Pick Lock (Non-Trade Related)

Description: Attempting to open a locked door, chest, or container that is not part of an active merchant's stall or shop inventory (e.g., a private residence door, a personal chest, a records room door).
Requirements: A locked object, Lockpicks (Item, potentially consumed on use), sufficient privacy or concealment to perform the action without being observed.
Costs: Time (part of a Time Window), Focus (high, requires concentration), Lockpicks (potentially consumed on failure, or sometimes even on success depending on game balance).
Skills: Primarily Finesse. The difficulty should be based on the quality of the lock.
Yields: Access to the area or container contents (potentially yielding Items, Money, or Knowledge), moderate XP. Failure might result in breaking the lockpicks, making noise that attracts attention, triggering a trap, or leaving evidence of tampering.
5.4. Engage with Public Notices
Information in Marketford is disseminated through public postings and announcements. Players can interact with these systems by reading notice boards often found in central locations like the Market Square, near the Church door, or at the Town Hall entrance , or by listening to announcements made by a Town Crier in the streets.   

These notice boards and criers serve as dynamic information feeds. The content should change regularly, reflecting ongoing game events, new laws or regulations , upcoming festivals or market days , job postings or requests for aid , official warnings , price controls , wanted posters , or even personal messages or arguments. This makes repeatedly checking these sources a worthwhile activity. Engaging with this information might sometimes require specific skills (e.g., Lore to understand complex legal texts or archaic language, Insight to decipher coded messages or read between the lines) or even minor physical interactions (like using Finesse to discreetly tear off a contact tag from a notice ). Literacy itself might be a requirement or skill check for reading written notices.   

Action Example: Read Notice Board

Description: Examining a public notice board for information.
Requirements: Access to the Location Spot where the board is situated. Literacy may be required (potentially handled as a character trait or a low-level Lore check).
Costs: Time (part of a Time Window), Focus (minor).
Skills: Lore (to understand formal language, legal jargon, or unfamiliar symbols), Insight (to discern the relative importance of notices, identify potential subtext, or spot notices that seem out of place or suspicious).
Yields: Knowledge (new local laws, upcoming events, job postings/requests, warnings about dangers or individuals, current market prices, official proclamations), potential discovery of quest hooks, minor XP.
Action Example: Listen to Town Crier

Description: Paying attention to a public announcement being made by a town crier, often accompanied by a bell or gong to attract attention.   
Requirements: Be present in the Location Spot where the Crier is making their announcement during the correct Time Window.
Costs: Time (part of a Time Window), Focus (moderate, to hear clearly over street noise and potential crowds).
Skills: Insight (to understand the message clearly, especially if delivered quickly or with specific emphasis, and to gauge the reaction of the surrounding crowd).
Yields: Knowledge (similar types as the notice board, but potentially more immediate, time-sensitive news, or official decrees not yet posted), minor XP.

7. Note on Integration and Balance
Interconnectivity: The actions detailed above are designed not in isolation, but as an interconnected system. Knowledge gained through Gather Information, Scout Location, or Consult Information Sources can unlock new dialogue options, reveal targets for Search Area, or provide crucial modifiers for actions like Petition an Official or Bypass Security. Social actions like Build Relationship are prerequisites for accessing Mentorship or gaining trust for Formal Interactions. Success in demanding actions relies on maintaining personal resources through Rest & Recovery, while Skill Practice improves the efficacy of numerous other actions. Effective play will involve weaving these different action types together strategically.

Balancing Philosophy: Central to the design is Marketford's tight action economy. Time is the most critical constraint, followed by the expenditure of Energy and Focus. The costs and yields presented for each action serve as a baseline and will require careful tuning during implementation and playtesting. The goal is to ensure that players face meaningful choices constantly. No single action should be universally optimal; the best course of action should always depend on the player's immediate goals, the current situation within the game world (including Time Window and active events), available resources, and character build. The system should support various playstyles—whether focused on social maneuvering, investigation, stealth, or civic participation—by providing viable and rewarding action loops for each.

Further Development: The specific numerical values for costs and yields need rigorous playtesting to achieve the desired balance. The system can be further enriched by adding more nuanced actions specific to unique locations within Marketford, tied to particular NPCs, or triggered by unfolding plot events. Variations within actions (e.g., different types of favors, different levels of security to bypass) can also add depth. Consideration should also be given to how external factors like weather or town-wide events might temporarily modify the costs, risks, or availability of certain actions.
