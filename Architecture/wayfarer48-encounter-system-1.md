# The Wayfarer's Resolve: Universal Encounter System

## System Overview

**The Wayfarer's Resolve** is Wayfarer's core encounter system that transforms all player interactions—whether physical, social, or intellectual—into strategic, narrative-driven experiences. The system operates on the principle that every meaningful choice offers guaranteed positive outcomes while threatening negative consequences that can be mitigated through character skill.

### Key Features

- **Universal Mechanics**: Same rules apply to cleaning taverns, negotiating with merchants, or researching ancient texts
- **Narrative Integration**: Each choice is a story beat with mechanical significance
- **Resource Management**: Finite Focus Points create meaningful scarcity throughout encounters
- **Character Specialization**: Different skill builds naturally excel at different approaches
- **Strategic Depth**: Simple rules create complex decision spaces through interaction

### Scope and Purpose

This system replaces all encounter resolution in Wayfarer, serving as the mechanical engine that drives:
- Commission step completion
- Character skill expression
- Resource and time management
- Narrative progression within encounters
- Strategic planning and adaptation



## Core Philosophy and Design Principles

### 1. Positive Certainty with Risk Management

Every action provides guaranteed positive outcomes. The strategic challenge lies in risk assessment: do you have the skill to avoid the negative consequence, or is the risk worth accepting?

**Example**: "Start clearing debris" always gives you 2 Force tokens, but threatens to lose 1 Progress Marker unless you pass a Strength check.

### 2. Universal Templates, Contextual Expression

The same mechanical templates work across all encounter types. Strategic depth emerges from:
- Different skill mappings per encounter type
- Varied narrative contexts making identical mechanics feel distinct
- Location properties that modify choice effectiveness
- Character specializations creating preferred paths

### 3. Resource Scarcity Drives Strategy

**Finite Focus Points** (like Sir Brante's Willpower) create encounter-long pressure where every expenditure must be carefully considered. This transforms simple choices into strategic investments.

### 4. Intermediary Systems Create Depth

**Aspect Tokens** serve as intermediary resources between early preparation and final execution. Players must build the right portfolio of tokens early to access preferred conversion options later.

### 5. Binary Skill Resolution

Skill checks have binary outcomes: success negates the negative consequence, failure allows it to trigger. This eliminates randomness in positive outcomes while maintaining skill-based risk mitigation.



## Fundamental Components

### Focus Points (Encounter Resource)

**Definition**: The finite pool of willpower available for an entire encounter.

**Characteristics**:
- **Starting Amount**: 5-6 points for standard 3-round encounters
- **Refresh Cycle**: Does not refresh during encounters
- **Purpose**: Primary currency for activating Action Cards
- **Scaling**: Adjusted for encounter length (2-round: 6-7, 4-round: 5-7)

**Strategic Impact**: Creates constant opportunity cost decisions where spending Focus early reduces options later.

### Aspect Tokens (Intermediary Resources)

**Definition**: Four universal tokens representing fundamental problem-solving approaches.

**Token Types**:
1. **Force** (Red): Direct, powerful application
2. **Flow** (Blue): Adaptive, responsive approach  
3. **Focus** (Yellow): Concentrated, precise effort
4. **Fortitude** (Green): Sustained, patient approach

**Characteristics**:
- **Persistence**: Remain in Encounter Aspect Pool until spent or encounter ends
- **Generation**: Acquired through Action Card positive effects
- **Consumption**: Spent through conversion Action Cards to generate Progress
- **Portfolio Strategy**: Different combinations enable different conversion opportunities

### Progress Markers (Success Metric)

**Definition**: Universal measure of advancement toward encounter objectives.

**Characteristics**:
- **Single Type**: No subtypes or categories
- **Accumulation**: Gained through token conversion or direct Action Card effects
- **Thresholds**: Encounters define success levels (e.g., 8+ Good, 12+ Excellent)
- **Modification**: Some negative consequences can alter required thresholds

### Skill Checks (Risk Mitigation)

**Definition**: Binary tests that determine whether negative consequences trigger.

**Mechanics**:
- **Success Rates**: 
  - Skill 2+ below difficulty: Choice unavailable
  - Skill 1 below difficulty: 25% success
  - Skill equals difficulty: 50% success  
  - Skill 1+ above difficulty: 75% success
  - Skill 2+ above difficulty: Automatic success
- **Purpose**: Solely to negate negative consequences, never to determine positive outcomes
- **Mapping**: Context-dependent based on encounter type and token involved



## Action Card Architecture

### Universal Structure

Every Action Card (representing a narrative choice) contains exactly these elements:

```
Narrative Description: [Thematic action text]
Focus Cost: [0-2 points from encounter pool]
Positive Effect: [Always happens - gain tokens OR convert tokens to progress]
Negative Consequence: [Always happens unless skill check succeeds]
Skill Check: [Mapped skill vs. difficulty - success negates negative]
```

### Focus Cost Distribution

**Optimal Balance** (per 3-round encounter):
- **70%** of choices cost 1 Focus (core decisions)
- **20%** of choices cost 2 Focus (premium powerful options)
- **10%** of choices cost 0 Focus (safety valve - always available)

### Positive Effect Categories

1. **Token Generation**: "Gain X [Token Type]"
2. **Token Conversion**: "Spend X tokens → Gain Y Progress"
3. **Utility**: Minor beneficial effects (draw cards, manipulate future choices)

### Negative Consequence Types

**Strategic Distribution**:
- **30%** Future cost increases ("Next choice costs +1 Focus")
- **25%** Token disruption ("Discard 1 random token")
- **25%** Threshold increases ("Final success requirements +1")
- **15%** Progress loss ("Lose 1 Progress Marker")
- **5%** Focus loss ("Lose 1 Focus Point")

**Design Principle**: Prioritize strategic pressure over immediate punishment.



## Universal Token System

### Skill-to-Token Mapping

The genius of the system lies in how the same strategic concepts (Force, Flow, Focus, Fortitude) manifest differently across encounter contexts through skill mapping.

#### Physical Encounters
- **Force** → **Strength**: Raw physical power
- **Flow** → **Agility**: Fluid movement and adaptation
- **Focus** → **Precision**: Careful, accurate work
- **Fortitude** → **Endurance**: Sustained physical effort

#### Social Encounters  
- **Force** → **Intimidation**: Forceful social pressure
- **Flow** → **Charm**: Reading and adapting to people
- **Focus** → **Persuasion**: Targeted, logical convincing
- **Fortitude** → **Deception**: Maintaining facades over time

#### Intellectual Encounters
- **Force** → **Analysis**: Cutting through complexity directly
- **Flow** → **Observation**: Noticing and responding to details
- **Focus** → **Knowledge**: Concentrated expertise application
- **Fortitude** → **Planning**: Long-term strategic thinking

### Token Synergies and Combinations

**Common Conversion Patterns**:
- **Balanced Execution**: 1 Force + 1 Flow + 1 Focus → 4 Progress
- **Direct Approach**: 2 Force + 1 Fortitude → 3 Progress + bonus
- **Methodical Work**: 2 Focus + 1 Fortitude → 3 Progress + efficiency bonus
- **Adaptive Solution**: 2 Flow + 1 Force → 2 Progress + future advantage

**Strategic Implications**: Early token building must anticipate later conversion opportunities, creating temporal strategy decisions.



## Encounter Flow and Structure

### Standard Three-Round Structure

**Round 1: Setup and Initial Approach**
- **Narrative**: Situation introduction and initial assessment
- **Choices**: Primarily token generation with some immediate progress options
- **Strategy**: Portfolio building for later rounds

**Round 2: Development and Major Effort**  
- **Narrative**: Situation development and increased stakes
- **Choices**: Mix of advanced token generation and first conversion opportunities
- **Strategy**: Major progress pushes while maintaining token flexibility

**Round 3: Resolution and Completion**
- **Narrative**: Final challenges and outcome determination
- **Choices**: Primarily conversion opportunities with varied requirements
- **Strategy**: Optimize final progress push based on accumulated tokens

### Encounter Initiation

1. **Player Context**: At location spot, selects action, chooses approach, exhausts card
2. **System Setup**: 
   - Assign Focus Points based on encounter length
   - Initialize empty Aspect Token pool
   - Set Progress requirements and round limit
   - Determine skill mappings based on encounter type
3. **Narrative Opening**: Present initial situation and first round choices

### Round Cycle

```
1. Situation Update
   ├── Present narrative development
   └── Show current Progress/Focus/Token status

2. Present Choices (3-4 options)
   ├── Always include 0-Focus safety option
   ├── Include 1-2 Focus generation options
   └── Include conversion options if tokens available

3. Player Selection
   ├── Choose one Action Card
   ├── Pay Focus cost
   └── Cannot select if insufficient Focus or tokens

4. Resolution
   ├── Apply positive effect (always happens)
   ├── Perform skill check
   └── Apply negative consequence if check fails

5. End of Round
   ├── Update all pools and status
   └── Continue to next round or end encounter
```

### Encounter Termination

**Standard End**: After final round, compare total Progress to thresholds
**Early End**: If player has insufficient Focus for any non-zero choices
**Success Levels**: 
- **Basic**: Meet minimum Progress threshold
- **Good**: Meet enhanced threshold  
- **Excellent**: Meet maximum threshold with efficiency bonuses

## Implementation Guidelines

### Encounter Design Checklist

**For Each New Encounter**:
1. **Categorize**: Physical, Social, or Intellectual primary focus
2. **Map Skills**: Assign 12 core skills to 4 token types for this context
3. **Set Parameters**: Focus pool size, round count, Progress thresholds
4. **Select Templates**: Choose 8-12 templates from universal library
5. **Create Narrative**: Write thematic descriptions for each template
6. **Balance Check**: Ensure token generation/conversion ratio allows multiple strategies

### Template Selection Guidelines

**Per 3-Round Encounter** (recommended distribution):
- **4-5** Token generation templates (mix of all 4 types)
- **3-4** Token conversion templates (varied requirements)
- **1** Mandatory 0-Focus safety template
- **1-2** Utility or special templates (optional)

### Skill Check Difficulty Guidelines

**Standard Difficulties**:
- **SCD 2**: Very accessible, low-skill actions
- **SCD 3**: Standard difficulty for most actions  
- **SCD 4**: Challenging actions requiring some specialization
- **SCD 5**: Expert-level actions for premium outcomes

**Difficulty Distribution** (per encounter):
- **20%** SCD 2 (accessible options)
- **50%** SCD 3 (standard challenges)
- **25%** SCD 4 (specialization rewards)
- **5%** SCD 5 (mastery showcase)

### Narrative Integration Best Practices

1. **Contextual Authenticity**: Same template should feel completely different across encounter types
2. **Consequence Logic**: Negative consequences should make intuitive sense within the narrative
3. **Progressive Stakes**: Round 1 choices feel preparatory, Round 3 choices feel decisive
4. **Character Voice**: Maintain consistency with player character's established personality and background



## Integration Points

### Daily Planning System Integration

**Morning Card Selection** influences encounter capabilities:
- **Approach Selection**: Physical/Social/Intellectual card determines encounter type
- **Skill Bonuses**: Card-provided skill bonuses affect success rates in encounters
- **Energy/Concentration**: Card costs indirectly limit encounter frequency per day

### Commission System Integration

**Encounter Outcomes** directly impact commission progress:
- **Progress Scaling**: Commission progress = Encounter Progress × multiplier
- **Quality Bonuses**: Excellent encounter outcomes provide bonus commission progress
- **Failure Handling**: Poor encounter outcomes still provide minimal commission progress

### Character Progression Integration

**Skill Development** through encounter results:
- **Experience Gains**: Using skills in encounters provides XP toward skill improvement
- **Specialization Benefits**: Higher skills improve success rates and reduce risk
- **Natural Advancement**: Players naturally improve at their preferred encounter approaches

### Location System Integration

**Environmental Modifiers** affect encounter dynamics:
- **Property Bonuses**: Location properties can reduce SCDs for specific token types
- **Contextual Options**: Some locations enable unique Action Card templates
- **Resource Access**: Location amenities affect Focus recovery between encounters

### Time and Resource Integration  

**Encounter Resolution** consumes game resources:
- **Time Advancement**: Each encounter consumes one time block
- **Resource Depletion**: Poor encounter outcomes can drain coins, energy, or other resources
- **Opportunity Cost**: Choosing one encounter approach prevents others during that time block



## Examples and Use Cases

### Complete Example: Tavern Cleaning (Physical Encounter)

**Setup**:
- **Character**: Roric (Strength 4, Agility 2, Precision 3, Endurance 3)
- **Focus Pool**: 5 points for entire encounter
- **Goal**: 10 Progress in 3 rounds
- **Token Mapping**: Force (Strength), Flow (Agility), Focus (Precision), Fortitude (Endurance)

#### Round 1: "The main floor is chaos after a brawl..."

**Available Choices**:

1. **"Survey the damage carefully"** (0 Focus - Safety Option)
   - Positive: Gain 1 Flow token
   - Negative: Final success thresholds +1
   - Skill: Agility 2 vs SCD 4 (unlikely success)

2. **"Start clearing biggest debris"** (1 Focus)
   - Positive: Gain 2 Force tokens  
   - Negative: Lose 1 Progress Marker
   - Skill: Strength 4 vs SCD 3 (likely success)

3. **"Organize cleaning approach"** (1 Focus)
   - Positive: Gain 2 Focus tokens
   - Negative: Next choice costs +1 Focus
   - Skill: Precision 3 vs SCD 3 (moderate success)

4. **"Settle in for steady work"** (2 Focus)
   - Positive: Gain 3 Fortitude tokens
   - Negative: Discard 1 random token
   - Skill: Endurance 3 vs SCD 4 (unlikely success)

**Player Decision**: Roric chooses "Start clearing biggest debris" (plays to his Strength advantage)

**Resolution**:
- Focus: 5 → 4 remaining
- Positive: Gains 2 Force tokens (Pool: {2 Force})
- Skill Check: Strength 4 vs SCD 3 = Success!
- Negative: Negated (no Progress loss)

#### Round 2: "Initial debris cleared, but the real work begins..."

**Available Choices**:

1. **"Continue careful observation"** (0 Focus - Safety Option)
   - Positive: Gain 1 Flow token
   - Negative: Final thresholds +1
   - Skill: Agility 2 vs SCD 4

2. **"Power through remaining work"** (1 Focus, requires 2 Force tokens)
   - Positive: Spend 2 Force → Gain 3 Progress
   - Negative: Lose 1 Focus Point from pool
   - Skill: Strength 4 vs SCD 4

3. **"Methodical cleaning"** (1 Focus)
   - Positive: Gain 2 Focus tokens
   - Negative: Next choice costs +1 Focus  
   - Skill: Precision 3 vs SCD 3

4. **"Adapt to spilled drinks"** (1 Focus)
   - Positive: Gain 2 Flow tokens
   - Negative: Discard 1 Force token
   - Skill: Agility 2 vs SCD 3

**Player Decision**: Roric has exactly the tokens needed for "Power through remaining work" and his Strength gives him a decent chance

**Resolution**:
- Focus: 4 → 3 remaining  
- Positive: Spends 2 Force tokens (Pool: {}), Gains 3 Progress (Total: 3)
- Skill Check: Strength 4 vs SCD 4 = Success! (50% chance)
- Negative: Negated (no Focus loss)

#### Round 3: "Final push to impress the innkeeper..."

**Available Choices**:

1. **"Take final careful look"** (0 Focus - Safety Option)
   - Positive: Gain 1 Focus token
   - Negative: Final thresholds +1
   - Skill: Precision 3 vs SCD 4

2. **"Quick polish everything"** (1 Focus)
   - Positive: Gain 1 Progress directly
   - Negative: Quality suffers (final assessment penalty)
   - Skill: Agility 2 vs SCD 3

3. **"Thorough final cleaning"** (2 Focus)
   - Positive: Gain 2 Progress + efficiency bonus
   - Negative: Exhaustion (lose 1 Focus from pool)
   - Skill: Endurance 3 vs SCD 4

4. **"Show off strength"** (1 Focus)
   - Positive: Gain 2 Force tokens
   - Negative: Break something (lose 1 Progress)
   - Skill: Strength 4 vs SCD 3

**Player Decision**: With 3 Focus remaining and needing 7 more Progress, Roric must make multiple actions or take the big risk

**Strategic Analysis**: 
- Option 2 + 4 = 2 Focus, potentially 3 Progress + 2 Force tokens
- Option 3 alone = 2 Focus, guaranteed 2+ Progress
- Safety + generation might not be enough

Roric chooses a combination strategy, first taking "Show off strength" to build tokens.

**Resolution**:
- Focus: 3 → 2 remaining
- Positive: Gains 2 Force tokens (Pool: {2 Force})  
- Skill Check: Strength 4 vs SCD 3 = Success!
- Negative: Negated (no Progress loss)

Then "Quick polish everything":
- Focus: 2 → 1 remaining
- Positive: Gains 1 Progress (Total: 4)
- Skill Check: Agility 2 vs SCD 3 = Failure! (25% chance)
- Negative: Quality penalty applies

**Final Result**: 4 Progress with quality penalty vs 10 Progress target = Basic completion with flaws

### Example Applications Across Encounter Types

#### Social Encounter: Merchant Negotiation

**Same Templates, Different Expression**:
- **Generate Force** → "Assert strong negotiating position" (Intimidation check)
- **Generate Flow** → "Read the merchant's tells and adapt" (Charm check)  
- **Basic Conversion** → "Combine pressure and charm for agreement" (1 Force + 1 Flow → 3 Progress)

#### Intellectual Encounter: Ancient Text Research

**Same Templates, Different Expression**:
- **Generate Force** → "Apply direct analytical approach" (Analysis check)
- **Generate Focus** → "Concentrate expertise on key passages" (Knowledge check)
- **Premium Conversion** → "Synthesize analysis, observation, and knowledge" (1 Force + 1 Flow + 1 Focus → 4 Progress)



## Design Rationale

### Why Universal Templates Work

**Learning Efficiency**: Players master one set of mechanics that applies everywhere, reducing cognitive load while maintaining strategic depth.

**Development Efficiency**: Designers create encounters by selecting templates and writing narrative, not designing unique mechanics.

**Balance Consistency**: Same mechanical relationships across all encounters means balance testing applies universally.

**Strategic Transferability**: Skills learned in one encounter type inform decisions in others, rewarding system mastery.

### Why Focus Scarcity Creates Engagement

**Meaningful Choices**: When every expenditure matters, every decision becomes strategic rather than routine.

**Temporal Strategy**: Players must plan across multiple rounds, not just optimize individual choices.

**Character Differentiation**: Different skill builds face different risk/reward calculations, creating natural specialization.

**Tension Maintenance**: Constant resource pressure prevents encounters from becoming rote or predictable.

### Why Positive Certainty Improves Experience

**Player Agency**: Every choice provides guaranteed value, ensuring player actions feel impactful.

**Risk Clarity**: Players can clearly evaluate trade-offs between guaranteed gains and potential penalties.

**Skill Relevance**: Character abilities become tools for risk mitigation rather than gates to basic functionality.

**Forward Momentum**: Encounters always progress, preventing frustrating stagnation from bad luck.

### Why Intermediary Resources Add Depth

**Temporal Strategy**: Building tokens early to enable conversions later creates multi-round planning.

**Portfolio Management**: Different token combinations enable different strategies, rewarding adaptability.

**Opportunity Recognition**: Players must identify which tokens to prioritize based on available conversions.

**Resource Tension**: Token generation competes with immediate progress, creating strategic trade-offs.
