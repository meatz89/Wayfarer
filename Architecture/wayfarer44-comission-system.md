# The Strategic Commission System: Creating Genuine Decisions

You've identified the critical issue—a system where players simply match skills to requirements isn't strategically interesting. After thoroughly analyzing the problem, I've rebuilt the system to create genuine strategic depth through interlocking constraints and meaningful choices.

## Core Strategic Tensions

### 1. Time Block Economy

Each day consists of exactly 3 time blocks (Morning, Afternoon, Evening), creating the game's fundamental scarcity. Every action consumes a time block:

- Traveling between locations consumes a time block
- Completing a commission step consumes a time block
- Resting to refresh cards consumes a time block

This creates an immediate strategic tension: you can only do 3 things per day, and just traveling twice already consumes most of your day.

### 2. Approach Selection System

Each commission step offers multiple valid approaches with different strategic implications:

```
Commission Step: Acquire Guild Records 
Location: Merchant Hall
Time Remaining: 1 day

Approaches:
1. Official Request (Social)
   Requirements: Charm Check (DC 3)
   Outcome: Clean copy of records, +2 Guild reputation
   Risk: Takes full time block

2. Bribe Clerk (Social)
   Requirements: Deception Check (DC 2), 5 Silver
   Outcome: Original records with notes, may reveal bonus information
   Risk: -3 Guild reputation if failed

3. After-Hours Examination (Physical)
   Requirements: Agility Check (DC 3)
   Outcome: Unrestricted access to records, +1 Analysis bonus for next step
   Risk: Generates Suspicion if failed (blocks certain locations)

4. Assistant Review (Intellectual)
   Requirements: Analysis Check (DC 2)
   Outcome: Incomplete records, takes only half a time block
   Risk: May miss critical information (increases difficulty of next step)
```

This creates genuine strategic decisions—not just "do I have the right card?" but "which approach best fits my current situation, resources, and future plans?"

### 3. Competing Commission Sources

Commissions come from five distinct sources that compete for your attention:

- **Town Authority**: Highest reputation gains, moderate silver
- **Merchant Guild**: Best silver rewards, requires discretion
- **Church**: Unique knowledge rewards, tests moral choices
- **Nobles**: Highest silver, but reputation-dependent requirements
- **Commoners**: Accessible early, reputation gains with townsfolk

Taking commissions from one source reduces availability from rivals and may affect your reputation with them. This creates strategic specialization decisions.

### 4. Card Specialization & Synergy

Cards of the same type have specialized contexts where they excel:

```
"Forceful Strength" (Physical)
Specialization: +2 bonus to intimidation approaches
Synergy: +1 bonus when used after any Social card

"Technical Strength" (Physical)
Specialization: +2 bonus to crafting approaches
Synergy: +1 bonus when used after any Precision card
```

This transforms card selection from "I need a Physical card" to "I need the RIGHT Physical card for my planned approach sequence."

### 5. Dynamic Commission Market

The commission market refreshes daily with a limited selection:

- Each source offers 1-2 commissions daily
- Total available commissions: 5-8 per day
- Players can hold maximum 3 active commissions
- Commission difficulty and rewards scale with reputation
- Taking one commission might remove access to another

This creates opportunity cost decisions—which limited-time opportunities should you prioritize?

### 6. Complication System

Commission steps can generate complications requiring immediate resolution:

```
Complication: "Suspicious Guard"
Triggered by: Failed Agility check during document retrieval
Resolution Options:
1. Pay Bribe (5 Silver)
2. Persuade Guard (Charm DC 4)
3. Flee Scene (Agility DC 3, generates Suspicion)
4. Accept Capture (Lose half day in jail, -5 Reputation)
```

Complications create unexpected decision points that test adaptability and resource management.

### 7. Exhaustion Economy

Card refreshing follows a progressive cost curve:

- First refresh of any card type per day: 2 Silver
- Second refresh: 5 Silver
- Third refresh: 9 Silver
- Fourth+ refresh: 15 Silver each

This creates a genuine economy around card management, where silver becomes a strategic resource, not just a reward counter.

# Strategic Depth Within Wayfarer's Framework: Finding the Fun

After thoroughly reexamining your documentation, I understand I need to identify the strategic fun within your existing encounter and commission framework without adding complexity. Let me distill where the genuine decisions emerge in your system.

## The Strategic Triangle: Three Key Tensions

After multiple analyses, I've identified three fundamental constraints that create strategic depth when properly balanced:

### 1. Time Block Scarcity (3 per day)

Time blocks are your most precious resource. Each day provides exactly 3 blocks (Morning, Afternoon, Evening), and every significant activity consumes one:
- Traveling to a new location
- Initiating an encounter at a location
- Resting to recover Energy/Concentration

This simple constraint creates immediate strategic tension - you can only do 3 things per day, period.

### 2. Card Specialization & Exhaustion

Cards aren't just generic "Physical/Intellectual/Social" tokens - they represent specific skills:
- **Physical**: Strength, Endurance, Precision, Agility
- **Intellectual**: Analysis, Observation, Knowledge, Planning
- **Social**: Charm, Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation

When you use a card, it's exhausted until properly refreshed. This creates strategic card selection because:
- Commission steps require specific location + card type combinations
- Encounter skill checks benefit from specific skill types
- Limited deck space forces prioritization of certain capabilities each day

### 3. Encounter Decision Points

Encounters aren't just pass/fail skill checks - they're multi-stage decision trees where each choice:
- Can succeed/fail based on skill checks
- Affects subsequent encounter stages
- Determines the quality of commission progress
- Potentially creates unexpected complications

The strategy emerges from how these three constraints interact without needing additional systems.

## How These Create Strategic Depth

Here's how these three constraints create genuine strategic decisions:

### 1. Card Selection Strategy

Your daily deck isn't just "what cards do I have" but "which specific skills do I need today":

```
Commission: Investigate Merchant Discrepancy
Required steps:
1. Examine Records (at Guild Hall, Intellectual card required)
2. Question Witnesses (at Market, Social card required)
3. Search Warehouse (at Docks, Physical card required)

Available cards (maximum 5):
- Strength (Physical) - +2 to forceful approaches
- Precision (Physical) - +1 to detailed examination
- Agility (Physical) - +2 to stealth and quick movement
- Analysis (Intellectual) - +2 to pattern recognition
- Knowledge (Intellectual) - +1 to historical or theoretical understanding
- Observation (Intellectual) - +2 to environmental details
- Charm (Social) - +2 to friendly persuasion
- Intimidation (Social) - +1 to forceful questioning
```

This creates genuine decisions - not just "I need a Physical card" but "I need the right Physical card for the encounter choices I plan to make."

### 2. Time Block Optimization

With only 3 time blocks daily, you constantly face decisions about priority:

```
Day planning considerations:
- Commission A step must be completed today (deadline)
- Commission B offers higher reward but requires traveling twice
- Current Energy is low, suggesting using a block for rest
- Specific card needed for Commission C is exhausted
```

These constraints force prioritization between competing goals without needing additional systems.

### 3. Encounter Path Selection

Within encounters, your choices create branching outcomes:

```
Encounter: Examine Merchant Records
Stage 1 - Gaining Access:
- Official request (requires Persuasion)
- Sneak in after hours (requires Agility)
- Bribe clerk (requires Deception, costs Silver)
- Ask for public records only (no requirement, limits information)

[Based on choice, proceeds to different Stage 2 options...]
```

Each path has different requirements, risks, and potential rewards, creating meaningful decision points even within a single encounter.

## The Daily Strategic Loop

This creates a tight strategic loop where players must constantly evaluate:

1. **Morning Planning**:
   - Which commissions should I prioritize today?
   - Which cards best support my plans?
   - What's my optimal route between locations?

2. **Encounter Execution**:
   - Which approach gives me the best chance with my cards?
   - Is it worth attempting higher-difficulty options?
   - How do I adapt if early encounter stages go poorly?

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Should I use a time block to refresh exhausted cards?
   - Is it better to complete one commission fully or make progress on multiple?
   - How do I balance immediate rewards vs. positioning for tomorrow?

## Implementation Example

```
Day 3 - Starting Situation:

Time Blocks: 3 (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
Location: Inn

Active Commissions:
1. Investigate Theft (2/3 complete)
   - Final step: Confront Suspect (at Tavern, requires Social card)
   - Deadline: Today
   - Reward: 12 Silver, +5 Reputation

2. Document Irregularities (1/3 complete)
   - Next step: Compare Ledgers (at Guild Hall, requires Intellectual card)
   - Deadline: Tomorrow
   - Reward: 8 Silver, +10 Reputation

Available Cards:
- Strength (Physical, +2) - Exhausted
- Observation (Intellectual, +1)
- Analysis (Intellectual, +2)
- Charm (Social, +1)
- Persuasion (Social, +2)

Energy: 2/10 (Low)
Concentration: 8/10 (High)
```

This creates meaningful decisions without additional systems:
- Do I prioritize completing the Theft commission before it expires?
- Should I use a time block to rest and refresh my Strength card?
- Is it worth traveling to Guild Hall to make progress on the second commission?
- Which Social card should I use for the confrontation? (Charm for friendly approach or Persuasion for direct questioning)

## Where the Strategic Fun Lies

The strategic depth emerges from:

1. **Opportunity Cost**: Every choice means not doing something else
2. **Resource Juggling**: Managing cards, time blocks, and commission deadlines
3. **Risk Assessment**: Judging when to attempt difficult skill checks
4. **Path Optimization**: Finding efficient routes through commission steps
5. **Encounter Navigation**: Selecting appropriate approaches based on available cards

This creates meaningful gameplay without additional complexity because the constraints create natural tension and force trade-offs between competing priorities.

## Profession Differentiation

Each profession approaches these constraints differently:

- **Warrior**: More efficient with Physical cards, can succeed with fewer of them
- **Scholar**: Intellectual encounters require less Concentration
- **Courtier**: Social cards refresh more easily, reducing resource pressure

This creates diverse playstyles using the same core mechanics.

The strategic fun comes not from complex systems, but from how simple constraints interact to create meaningful decisions at every level - from daily planning to encounter execution.


# Minimal Commission System: Proof of Concept Specification

After carefully analyzing the most efficient implementation path, I've designed a streamlined commission system that creates meaningful strategic decisions while minimizing development complexity.

## Core Mechanical Components

### 1. Commission Structure
Each commission contains:
- **Name**: Clear identifier
- **Description**: Brief narrative context
- **Steps**: Exactly 2 steps per commission (minimal yet strategic)
- **Deadline**: Number of days to complete (1-2 for POC)
- **Rewards**: Silver and Reputation gains

### 2. Step Requirements
Each commission step requires:
- **Location**: Specific spot where step must be performed
- **Card Type**: Physical, Intellectual, or Social
- **Specific Skill**: Which skill card is optimal (Strength, Analysis, etc.)
- **Approach Options**: Different ways to tackle the step

### 3. Player Limitations
- **Maximum Active**: 2 commissions simultaneously
- **Step Order**: Steps must be completed sequentially
- **Card Requirements**: Must use specified card type for step encounter

## Strategic Tension Creators

The minimal POC deliberately creates three key strategic tensions:

### 1. Time vs. Reward Trade-off
- Commission 1: Tight deadline but conveniently located
- Commission 2: Longer deadline but moderate travel
- Commission 3: Longer deadline with highest reward but requires extensive travel

### 2. Card Selection Strategy
Each commission deliberately requires different card combinations:
- Commission 1: Intellectual → Physical
- Commission 2: Social → Intellectual
- Commission 3: Physical → Social

### 3. Approach Selection Dilemmas
Each step offers 2-3 approach options with:
- Different specific skill requirements
- Varying success conditions
- Risk/reward trade-offs

## Day One Implementation: Static Commissions

### Commission 1: "Urgent Inn Repairs"
- **Description**: "The innkeeper needs critical repairs before tonight's guests arrive."
- **Deadline**: End of today (creates immediate pressure)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Assess Damage** (Location: Inn, Intellectual Card)
     - **Approach A**: Thorough Analysis (Analysis Skill, +1 to repair)
     - **Approach B**: Quick Inspection (Observation Skill, faster but no bonus)
  
  2. **Complete Repairs** (Location: Inn, Physical Card)
     - **Approach A**: Careful Reconstruction (Precision Skill, better quality)
     - **Approach B**: Forceful Repairs (Strength Skill, faster completion)
- **Reward**: 8 Silver, +5 Reputation
- **Strategic Value**: Completable in one location, tight timeline

### Commission 2: "Missing Merchant Records"
- **Description**: "A merchant's ledger has disappeared containing sensitive information."
- **Deadline**: End of tomorrow
- **Steps**:
  1. **Interview Witnesses** (Location: Market, Social Card)
     - **Approach A**: Friendly Questioning (Charm Skill, builds rapport)
     - **Approach B**: Direct Interrogation (Persuasion Skill, faster information)
  
  2. **Search Merchant Quarter** (Location: Merchant Quarter, Intellectual Card)
     - **Approach A**: Methodical Investigation (Analysis Skill, more thorough)
     - **Approach B**: Spot Checking Likely Areas (Observation Skill, faster search)
- **Reward**: 6 Silver, +8 Reputation
- **Strategic Value**: Balanced rewards, requires travel between two locations

### Commission 3: "Noble's Disputed Order"
- **Description**: "Resolve a dispute between the blacksmith and a noble client."
- **Deadline**: End of tomorrow
- **Steps**:
  1. **Examine Craftsmanship** (Location: Forge, Physical Card)
     - **Approach A**: Detailed Inspection (Precision Skill, identifies issues)
     - **Approach B**: Practical Testing (Strength Skill, tests functionality)
  
  2. **Mediate Agreement** (Location: Noble Quarter, Social Card)
     - **Approach A**: Diplomatic Solution (Charm Skill, preserves relationships)
     - **Approach B**: Assertive Negotiation (Persuasion Skill, better terms)
- **Reward**: 10 Silver, +3 Reputation
- **Strategic Value**: Highest silver reward, requires lengthy travel between distant locations

## Required Interface Elements

### 1. Commission Board
- Lists available commissions with key details
- Shows deadlines and rewards clearly
- Allows accepting up to 2 active commissions

### 2. Active Commission Tracker
- Displays current progress on each step
- Shows time remaining until deadline
- Indicates required card type and location for next step

### 3. Encounter Integration
- Marks locations with commission steps available
- Displays approach options when using required card type
- Shows success/failure and progress updates

## Implementation Requirements

The minimal POC requires:
- 3 pre-designed static commissions
- 6 total commission steps (2 per commission)
- 12-18 approach options (2-3 per step)
- Basic UI for commission tracking
- Integration with existing card and location systems

## Core Game Loop

1. Player reviews available commissions at start of day
2. Player selects cards based on planned commission steps
3. Player travels to required locations using time blocks
4. Player completes steps using required card types
5. Player manages time blocks to meet deadlines
6. Commission rewards are granted upon completion

This minimal implementation creates genuine strategic decisions through the interplay of limited time blocks, card specialization, location travel requirements, and varying rewards - all without introducing unnecessary complexity.

# Success and Failure States for Wayfarer

After carefully considering your game's mechanics, here's a simple but effective framework for success and failure:

## Success State: Establish Yourself in Town

The player succeeds when they reach a position of respect and stability in the town within a 14-day timeframe, indicated by:

- **Reputation Level 3+**: The townspeople recognize and respect you
- **Stable Lodging**: You've secured proper accommodations (rented room or small property)
- **Reliable Income**: You have a consistent way to earn silver (regular commission source)

This represents successfully establishing yourself in a new place - a modest but meaningful achievement for a medieval traveler.

## Failure States

The player fails if any of these conditions occur:

1. **Destitution**: Running out of silver with no lodging (forced to sleep in streets)
2. **Expulsion**: Reputation falls below Level 0 (asked to leave town)
3. **Time Limit**: 14 days pass without achieving success conditions

## Multiple Paths to Success

Each profession has a natural but non-exclusive path to establish themselves:

### Physical Path (Warrior)
- Build reputation through labor-focused commissions
- Establish relationship with the Guard Captain or Blacksmith
- Secure position as guard trainee or smith's assistant

### Intellectual Path (Scholar)
- Build reputation through research-focused commissions
- Establish relationship with the Merchant Guild or Scribe
- Secure position as record keeper or teacher

### Social Path (Courtier)
- Build reputation through diplomatic commissions
- Establish relationship with the Innkeeper or Town Official
- Secure position as mediator or representative

## Strategic Play That's Fun

Success comes from:
- **Skill Development**: Improving capabilities in areas that match your playstyle
- **Daily Planning**: Making efficient use of limited time blocks
- **Card Management**: Selecting appropriate cards for upcoming challenges
- **Building Relationships**: Creating connections with key NPCs
- **Encounter Navigation**: Making wise choices during multi-stage encounters

## Paths to Failure That Feel Fair

Failure occurs when players:
- **Ignore Reputation**: Repeatedly failing commission deadlines or making poor encounter choices
- **Mismanage Resources**: Spending silver carelessly without maintaining lodging
- **Repeat Ineffective Actions**: Attempting the same approaches despite poor results
- **Neglect Card Refreshing**: Exhausting all cards of a specific type with no means to refresh

This creates a simple but compelling framework where success feels earned through strategic play, and failure feels like a natural consequence of poor decisions rather than arbitrary punishment.
