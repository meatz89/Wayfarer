# The Wayfarer's Resolve: Universal Encounter System Documentation

## Core Design Philosophy

The Wayfarer's Resolve represents a complete encounter system designed around the principle of "picking your poison" - every meaningful choice provides guaranteed positive effects while threatening negative consequences that can be mitigated through character skill. This creates strategic depth through risk management and opportunity cost evaluation rather than complex rule interactions.

The system draws inspiration from Splendor's tier-based progression model, where players can see exactly what options will be available in future stages, enabling forward-planning satisfaction. Unlike perfect information games that rely on mathematical optimization, this system creates strategic tension through managing escalating costs and accumulating resources under time pressure.

The fundamental strategic challenge emerges from the dotAge principle of necessary sacrifice - players must accept certain negative effects to build the capabilities needed for success. This creates compelling decision trees where every choice involves evaluating which problems you can afford to accept while building toward your objectives.

## Universal Framework Components

### Core Resources

**Focus Points** serve as the encounter's primary currency, representing the finite pool of mental and physical effort available for significant actions. Each encounter begins with exactly 6 Focus Points that do not refresh during the encounter. This scarcity creates the foundational strategic pressure where every expenditure carries genuine opportunity cost.

**Aspect Tokens** function as the encounter's intermediate resource system, representing accumulated capabilities that can be converted into progress toward objectives. The system uses exactly four universal token types - Force, Flow, Focus, and Fortitude - that map to different skills based on encounter context. These tokens persist in the player's Encounter Aspect Pool until spent or the encounter ends.

**Progress Markers** represent advancement toward encounter objectives, serving as the universal success metric across all encounter types. Players accumulate Progress through various actions, primarily by converting accumulated Aspect Tokens through strategic choices.

### Skill System and Token Mapping

The game employs exactly twelve skills organized into three categories of four skills each. Physical Skills include Strength, Endurance, Precision, and Agility. Intellectual Skills encompass Analysis, Observation, Knowledge, and Planning. Social Skills consist of Charm, Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation.

The universal token system creates thematic coherence across different encounter types through context-specific skill mapping. Physical Encounters map Force to Strength, Flow to Agility, Focus to Precision, and Fortitude to Endurance. Intellectual Encounters map Force to Analysis, Flow to Observation, Focus to Knowledge, and Fortitude to Planning. Social Encounters map Force to Intimidation, Flow to Charm, Focus to Persuasion, and Fortitude to Deception.

This mapping system allows identical mechanical templates to feel completely different across encounter types while maintaining universal rule consistency. The same strategic concepts of applying force, adapting flow, concentrating focus, and maintaining fortitude translate naturally to physical labor, intellectual investigation, and social negotiation contexts.

## Stage Progression and Tier Structure

### Five-Stage Encounter Architecture

Every encounter consists of exactly five stages that create a natural progression arc mirroring Splendor's tier advancement. This structure enables the forward-planning satisfaction that makes strategic preparation rewarding while maintaining narrative development through increasing stakes and complexity.

The five stages are organized into three distinct tiers that create escalating cost and reward structures. Stages 1-2 represent the Foundation Tier, where players establish their basic resource accumulation strategies. Stages 3-4 form the Development Tier, where accumulated resources enable more powerful actions. Stage 5 constitutes the Execution Tier, where players leverage their built capabilities for final major progress pushes.

### Tier-Based Template Scaling

Each tier maintains balanced efficiency ratios while requiring progressively larger investments, creating the Splendor dynamic where players naturally progress from small accessible actions to large game-changing moves as their resource engine develops.

**Foundation Tier (Stages 1-2) Templates:**
Generation A provides 3 tokens for 1 Focus Point, establishing the basic resource accumulation rate. Generation B offers 2 tokens for 1 Focus Point, serving as the precision option when exact token quantities are needed. Conversion A transforms 1 token plus 1 Focus Point into 2 Progress Markers, providing immediate but modest advancement. Conversion B converts 2 tokens plus 1 Focus Point into 4 Progress Markers, rewarding early token accumulation. The Hybrid option combines 1 Focus Point into 1 token plus 1 Progress Marker, providing balanced immediate and future value. Recovery remains available at 0 Focus Point cost, providing emergency resource replenishment.

**Development Tier (Stages 3-4) Templates:**
Generation A advances to 4 tokens for 1 Focus Point, improving efficiency for dedicated token builders. Generation B scales to 6 tokens for 2 Focus Points, providing bulk accumulation for resource-rich players. Conversion A requires 2 tokens plus 1 Focus Point for 4 Progress Markers, maintaining steady advancement rates. Conversion B demands 3 tokens plus 1 Focus Point for 6 Progress Markers, rewarding substantial token investment. The Hybrid option expands to 3 tokens plus 2 Progress Markers for 2 Focus Points, creating meaningful competition with separate actions. Recovery continues at 0 Focus Point cost for emergency situations.

**Execution Tier (Stage 5) Templates:**
Generation A maintains 4 tokens for 1 Focus Point, ensuring accessibility for final resource building. Generation B provides 6 tokens for 2 Focus Points, enabling last-minute portfolio construction. Conversion A offers 5 Progress Markers for 2 tokens plus 1 Focus Point, providing enhanced efficiency for final pushes. Conversion B delivers 7 Progress Markers for 3 tokens plus 1 Focus Point, creating powerful culmination opportunities. The Hybrid option combines 1 token plus 3 Progress Markers for 1 Focus Point, offering balanced final advancement. Recovery remains at 0 Focus Point cost as the ultimate safety valve.

## Action Card Template System

### Universal Template Distribution

Every stage presents exactly six Action Card options following a fixed distribution that guarantees strategic viability regardless of player resource state. Each stage provides two Generation options requiring no tokens, two Conversion options with different token requirements, one Hybrid option combining generation and conversion, and one Recovery option requiring no Focus Points.

This distribution ensures that players always have at least three accessible options - two Generation choices and one Recovery choice - regardless of their current token portfolio. This prevents the dead state scenarios that would break strategic flow while maintaining meaningful choice differentiation.

### Template Mechanical Structure

Every Action Card follows an identical mechanical structure that creates consistent player expectations while allowing narrative variation. Each card specifies its Focus Point cost, positive effect that always occurs when requirements are met, immediate negative consequence that triggers unless mitigated, and skill check that determines whether the negative consequence can be avoided.

The positive effects fall into three categories that define the card's strategic function. Generation effects provide specific quantities of Aspect Tokens to build future capabilities. Conversion effects transform accumulated tokens into Progress Markers toward encounter objectives. Hybrid effects combine generation and conversion to provide immediate value while building future options.

Negative consequences use immediate effects only, eliminating complex state tracking while maintaining strategic pressure. These consequences create evaluation moments where players must decide whether the guaranteed positive effect justifies the potential negative impact based on their current situation and skill capabilities.

## Negative Effect System

### Immediate Impact Philosophy

The system employs only immediate negative effects that resolve instantly when triggered, eliminating the complexity of persistent penalties or state tracking across multiple rounds. This design choice maintains strategic pressure while ensuring that every decision's consequences are clearly understood and immediately resolved.

### Complete Negative Effect Taxonomy

The system uses exactly five negative effect types that cover all strategic pressure needs without overlap or complexity. "Lose 1 Progress Marker" creates immediate tactical pressure by reducing accumulated advancement. "Lose 1 Focus Point" constrains future action availability by reducing the encounter's primary currency. "This generation produces 1 fewer token" reduces the efficiency of the current action without affecting future capabilities. "This conversion yields 1 less Progress" diminishes immediate advancement while preserving resource accumulation. "Success thresholds increase by 1" raises the difficulty of achieving encounter objectives, creating long-term strategic pressure.

These effects create different strategic pressures that cannot be directly compared, forcing players to evaluate which type of negative impact they can best absorb given their current position and planned strategy. The variety ensures that different character builds and strategic approaches face different risk profiles for identical actions.

### Risk Mitigation Through Skill Checks

Every Action Card includes a skill check that serves solely to negate the negative consequence if successful. These checks use binary outcomes - success prevents the negative effect entirely, while failure allows it to trigger. This eliminates randomness in positive outcomes while maintaining skill-based risk assessment for negative consequences.

Skill check difficulties follow a simple pattern based on tier and action power. Foundation tier actions typically use SCD 3 for standard difficulty, while Development and Execution tier actions use SCD 4 for increased challenge. This scaling ensures that more powerful actions carry proportionally higher risk, creating meaningful strategic evaluation moments.

## Recovery Mechanics

### Universal Recovery Option

Every stage provides the "Gather Resolve" option at 0 Focus Point cost, serving as the universal safety valve when players face resource depletion. This option provides exactly 1 Focus Point up to the encounter's starting maximum, ensuring that players cannot exceed their initial resource allocation while providing emergency relief.

### Cascading Negative Structure

Gather Resolve employs a cascading negative consequence system that creates escalating pressure as player position deteriorates. If the player has 1 or more Progress Markers, the negative effect removes 1 Progress Marker. If the player has 0 Progress Markers but possesses 2 or more Aspect Tokens, the effect discards 2 random tokens. If the player has neither Progress Markers nor sufficient tokens, the effect increases success thresholds by 1.

This cascading structure ensures that recovery becomes increasingly expensive as player position weakens, creating strategic pressure to avoid relying on emergency measures while maintaining the option for crisis management. The skill check uses SCD 4 to reflect the difficulty of maintaining resolve under pressure.

## Victory Conditions and Scaling

### Three-Tier Success Structure

Encounters employ a three-tier success structure that rewards different levels of strategic execution while ensuring that competent play achieves meaningful advancement. Basic Success requires 10 Progress Markers, representing solid execution that accomplishes encounter objectives. Good Success demands 14 Progress Markers, rewarding optimal play and efficient resource management. Excellent Success requires 18 Progress Markers, challenging players to achieve near-perfect execution or creative risk-taking.

These thresholds ensure that multiple strategic approaches remain viable while creating aspirational goals for skilled players. The progression from 10 to 14 to 18 Progress creates meaningful differentiation between success levels without requiring impossible optimization.

### Encounter Scaling Framework

Different encounter types can adjust these base thresholds to reflect their specific challenges and narrative stakes. Minor encounters might reduce thresholds by 2-3 Progress Markers, while major encounters might increase them by the same amount. This scaling maintains the system's universal application while allowing appropriate difficulty variation.

## Complete Implementation Algorithm

### Encounter Initialization

Every encounter begins by establishing the encounter type (Physical, Intellectual, or Social) based on the player's chosen approach to the situation. The system applies the appropriate skill mapping to connect the four universal Aspect Tokens to specific character skills. The encounter grants exactly 6 Focus Points and initializes empty Aspect Token and Progress Marker pools.

### Stage Processing Loop

Each stage follows an identical processing sequence that maintains system consistency while allowing narrative variation. The system first presents the current situation through narrative description, then generates exactly six Action Card options based on the stage's tier and the fixed template distribution. The player selects one available Action Card, pays its Focus Point cost, and applies its positive effect immediately.

The system then processes the skill check using the card's specified skill against its difficulty rating. Success negates the negative consequence entirely, while failure triggers the immediate negative effect. All resource pools update to reflect the action's complete resolution before proceeding to the next stage.

### Narrative Integration Points

The system provides clear integration points for narrative generation while maintaining mechanical consistency. Each Action Card requires thematic description that matches the encounter type and current situation development. The skill check can incorporate narrative elements that reflect the character's approach and the specific challenges they face. The resolution phase can include narrative consequences that reflect both the positive outcomes and any negative effects that triggered.

This integration framework ensures that the mechanical precision necessary for strategic gameplay combines seamlessly with the narrative richness that makes encounters feel like meaningful story moments rather than abstract resource optimization puzzles.

## Strategic Design Validation

The complete system successfully captures the forward-planning satisfaction of Splendor through its predictable tier progression, the necessary sacrifice pressure of dotAge through its immediate negative consequences, and the risk management challenge of Darkest Dungeon through its skill check mitigation system. Players can see exactly what options will be available in future stages, enabling strategic preparation while maintaining narrative surprise through dynamic situation development.

The mathematical relationships ensure that different strategic approaches achieve similar total progress through different risk and timing profiles, creating meaningful choice diversity without dominant strategies. The immediate negative effect system maintains pressure without complex state tracking, while the universal template structure ensures consistent learning across encounter types.

This design achieves the elegant simplicity you sought while providing the strategic depth necessary for engaging gameplay, creating a system that serves as the mechanical heart of Wayfarer's encounter resolution across all interaction types.

Looking at this challenge, I need to create numerical values that mirror Splendor's tier progression while maintaining balanced efficiency ratios. Let me work through the specific values systematically.

## Complete Numerical Framework

**Stage 1-2 (Foundation Tier):**
- Generation A: 1 Focus → 3 tokens
- Generation B: 1 Focus → 2 tokens
- Conversion A: 1 Focus + 1 token → 2 Progress
- Conversion B: 1 Focus + 2 tokens → 3 Progress
- Hybrid: 1 Focus → 1 token + 1 Progress
- Recovery: 0 Focus → +1 Focus

**Stage 3-4 (Development Tier):**
- Generation A: 1 Focus → 4 tokens
- Generation B: 2 Focus → 5 tokens
- Conversion A: 1 Focus + 2 tokens → 4 Progress
- Conversion B: 1 Focus + 3 tokens → 5 Progress
- Hybrid: 2 Focus → 2 tokens + 2 Progress
- Recovery: 0 Focus → +1 Focus

**Stage 5 (Execution Tier):**
- Generation A: 2 Focus → 5 tokens
- Generation B: 3 Focus → 7 tokens
- Conversion A: 1 Focus + 3 tokens → 6 Progress
- Conversion B: 1 Focus + 4 tokens → 7 Progress
- Hybrid: 2 Focus → 2 tokens + 3 Progress
- Recovery: 0 Focus → +1 Focus

## Efficiency Analysis

This creates the Splendor-style progression where efficiency improves subtly with each tier:

**Foundation Tier Efficiency:** 2.0 Progress per token (A), 1.5 Progress per token (B)
**Development Tier Efficiency:** 2.0 Progress per token (A), 1.67 Progress per token (B)
**Execution Tier Efficiency:** 2.0 Progress per token (A), 1.75 Progress per token (B)

The key insight is that while efficiency improvements are modest, the scale of single moves increases dramatically. Foundation tier maxes out at 3 Progress per action, while Execution tier can deliver 7 Progress per action.

## Mental Simulation Results

Let me walk through a complete encounter to test these values:

**Physical Encounter: "Repair Mill" - Target 12 Progress**

**Stage 1 (Foundation, 6 Focus, 0 tokens):**
Player chooses Generation A: 1 Focus → 3 Force tokens, succeeds skill check.
**State:** 5 Focus, 3 Force tokens, 0 progress

**Stage 2 (Foundation, 5 Focus, 3 tokens):**
Player chooses Conversion B: 1 Focus + 2 tokens → 3 Progress, succeeds.
**State:** 4 Focus, 1 Force token, 3 progress

**Stage 3 (Development, 4 Focus, 1 token):**
Player chooses Generation B: 2 Focus → 5 tokens, succeeds.
**State:** 2 Focus, 6 tokens total, 3 progress

**Stage 4 (Development, 2 Focus, 6 tokens):**
Player chooses Conversion B: 1 Focus + 3 tokens → 5 Progress, succeeds.
**State:** 1 Focus, 3 tokens, 8 progress

**Stage 5 (Execution, 1 Focus, 3 tokens):**
Only viable option is Conversion A: 1 Focus + 3 tokens → 6 Progress
**Final State:** 0 Focus, 0 tokens, 14 progress - Success!

## Critical Issues Discovered

**Issue 1: Stage 5 Accessibility Problem**
With only 1 Focus remaining in my simulation, most Stage 5 options become unaffordable. The Generation options cost 2-3 Focus, making them inaccessible when players arrive with minimal resources.

**Issue 2: Token Requirements Too Steep**
Stage 5 conversions requiring 3-4 tokens create accessibility barriers. Players might reach Stage 5 with insufficient tokens if they used earlier conversions or failed skill checks.

**Issue 3: Success Threshold Mismatch**
My simulation achieved 14 Progress against a 12 target, suggesting the scaling might be too generous for the target threshold.

## Refined Values (No Added Complexity)

**Stage 1-2 (Foundation - Unchanged):**
- Generation A: 1 Focus → 3 tokens
- Generation B: 1 Focus → 2 tokens
- Conversion A: 1 Focus + 1 token → 2 Progress
- Conversion B: 1 Focus + 2 tokens → 3 Progress
- Hybrid: 1 Focus → 1 token + 1 Progress
- Recovery: 0 Focus → +1 Focus

**Stage 3-4 (Development - Minor Adjustment):**
- Generation A: 1 Focus → 4 tokens
- Generation B: 2 Focus → 5 tokens
- Conversion A: 1 Focus + 2 tokens → 4 Progress
- Conversion B: 1 Focus + 3 tokens → 5 Progress
- Hybrid: 2 Focus → 2 tokens + 2 Progress
- Recovery: 0 Focus → +1 Focus

**Stage 5 (Execution - Accessibility Fix):**
- Generation A: 1 Focus → 4 tokens (reduced from 2 Focus)
- Generation B: 2 Focus → 6 tokens (reduced from 3 Focus)
- Conversion A: 1 Focus + 2 tokens → 5 Progress (reduced requirements)
- Conversion B: 1 Focus + 3 tokens → 6 Progress (reduced requirements)
- Hybrid: 1 Focus → 1 token + 3 Progress (reduced from 2 Focus)
- Recovery: 0 Focus → +1 Focus

## Validation Through Second Simulation

**Same encounter with refined values:**

**Stage 5 (1 Focus, 3 tokens):**
Now the player can choose:
- Conversion A: 1 Focus + 2 tokens → 5 Progress (total: 13 progress)
- Conversion B: 1 Focus + 3 tokens → 6 Progress (total: 14 progress)
- Hybrid: 1 Focus → 1 token + 3 Progress (total: 11 progress)

All options are accessible, creating meaningful strategic choice even when arriving with minimal resources.

These refined values maintain the Splendor-style tier progression while ensuring that all stages remain accessible regardless of player resource state. The efficiency improvements reward planning ahead, but the accessibility ensures that all strategic paths remain viable throughout the encounter.


Looking at the numerical framework systematically, I need to create values that mirror Splendor's elegant tier progression while ensuring all strategic paths remain viable. Let me work through this step-by-step, building up the mathematical relationships that will make the system both predictable and strategically rich.

## Foundational Efficiency Relationships

The key insight from Splendor is that each tier maintains roughly equal efficiency ratios while requiring progressively larger investments. This means a player spending 6 Focus across multiple small actions should achieve similar total progress to a player spending 6 Focus on fewer large actions, but with completely different risk and timing profiles.

Let me establish the core efficiency baseline: **2 Progress per token spent** as the standard conversion rate, with slight improvements in higher tiers to reward forward planning.

## Complete Refined Values

**Stage 1-2 (Foundation Tier):**
- Generation A: 1 Focus → 3 tokens
- Generation B: 1 Focus → 2 tokens
- Conversion A: 1 Focus + 1 token → 2 Progress
- Conversion B: 1 Focus + 2 tokens → 4 Progress
- Hybrid: 1 Focus → 1 token + 1 Progress
- Recovery: 0 Focus → +1 Focus

**Stage 3-4 (Development Tier):**
- Generation A: 1 Focus → 4 tokens
- Generation B: 2 Focus → 6 tokens
- Conversion A: 1 Focus + 2 tokens → 4 Progress
- Conversion B: 1 Focus + 3 tokens → 6 Progress
- Hybrid: 2 Focus → 2 tokens + 2 Progress
- Recovery: 0 Focus → +1 Focus

**Stage 5 (Execution Tier):**
- Generation A: 1 Focus → 4 tokens
- Generation B: 2 Focus → 6 tokens
- Conversion A: 1 Focus + 2 tokens → 5 Progress
- Conversion B: 1 Focus + 3 tokens → 7 Progress
- Hybrid: 1 Focus → 1 token + 3 Progress
- Recovery: 0 Focus → +1 Focus

## Mental Simulation Testing

Let me trace through multiple strategic approaches to validate these values work across different player preferences and skill check outcomes.

**Simulation 1: The Engine Builder Strategy**
This player prioritizes early token accumulation for big late-game conversions, mirroring Splendor's expensive card strategy.

**Stage 1:** Generation A (1 Focus → 3 tokens), succeeds skill check
**State:** 5 Focus, 3 tokens, 0 progress

**Stage 2:** Generation A (1 Focus → 3 tokens), succeeds skill check  
**State:** 4 Focus, 6 tokens, 0 progress

**Stage 3:** Conversion B (1 Focus + 3 tokens → 6 progress), succeeds skill check
**State:** 3 Focus, 3 tokens, 6 progress

**Stage 4:** Conversion B (1 Focus + 3 tokens → 6 progress), succeeds skill check
**State:** 2 Focus, 0 tokens, 12 progress

**Result:** Success achieved with 2 Focus remaining for safety margin. This demonstrates the engine-building path works efficiently when executed well.

**Simulation 2: The Steady Worker Strategy**
This player makes consistent smaller conversions throughout the encounter, similar to Splendor's balanced card acquisition approach.

**Stage 1:** Generation B (1 Focus → 2 tokens), succeeds skill check
**State:** 5 Focus, 2 tokens, 0 progress

**Stage 2:** Conversion B (1 Focus + 2 tokens → 4 progress), succeeds skill check
**State:** 4 Focus, 0 tokens, 4 progress

**Stage 3:** Generation A (1 Focus → 4 tokens), succeeds skill check
**State:** 3 Focus, 4 tokens, 4 progress

**Stage 4:** Conversion A (1 Focus + 2 tokens → 4 progress), succeeds skill check
**State:** 2 Focus, 2 tokens, 8 progress

**Stage 5:** Conversion A (1 Focus + 2 tokens → 5 progress), succeeds skill check
**State:** 1 Focus, 0 tokens, 13 progress

**Result:** Success achieved with excellent progress total. This validates that the steady approach remains highly viable.

**Simulation 3: Bad Luck Scenario**
Testing system robustness when skill checks fail and immediate penalties apply.

**Stage 1:** Generation A, fails skill check with "this generation produces 1 fewer token" penalty
**State:** 5 Focus, 2 tokens, 0 progress

**Stage 2:** Conversion B, fails skill check with "this conversion yields 1 less progress" penalty
**State:** 4 Focus, 0 tokens, 3 progress (instead of 4)

**Stage 3:** Generation A (1 Focus → 4 tokens), succeeds skill check
**State:** 3 Focus, 4 tokens, 3 progress

**Stage 4:** Conversion B (1 Focus + 3 tokens → 6 progress), succeeds skill check
**State:** 2 Focus, 1 token, 9 progress

**Stage 5:** Hybrid (1 Focus → 1 token + 3 progress), succeeds skill check
**State:** 1 Focus, 2 tokens, 12 progress

**Result:** Even with two failed skill checks and their penalties, success is still achievable. This demonstrates appropriate system resilience.

## Critical Issues Discovered

**Issue 1: Generation B Optimization Problem**
In my simulations, Generation A consistently outperforms Generation B in efficiency terms. Generation A provides 3 tokens per Focus while Generation B provides only 2 tokens per Focus. This creates a mathematical dominance that reduces meaningful choice.

However, this mirrors Splendor's design where cheaper cards exist for accessibility rather than efficiency. Generation B serves as the "backup option" when Focus is scarce or when you only need a small number of tokens for immediate conversions.

**Issue 2: Stage 3-4 Hybrid Efficiency**
The Development tier Hybrid (2 Focus → 2 tokens + 2 progress) competes poorly against separate actions. A player could use Generation A (1 Focus → 4 tokens) plus Conversion A (1 Focus + 2 tokens → 4 progress) for the same 2 Focus cost, gaining net 2 tokens plus 4 progress versus the Hybrid's 2 tokens plus 2 progress.

**Issue 3: Maximum Progress Ceiling**
The most efficient possible play (perfect skill checks, optimal strategy) can achieve roughly 15-16 progress, which might be too high if the target threshold is 12 progress. This could make encounters feel too easy for skilled players.

## Final Refinements (No Added Complexity)

**Refined Stage 3-4 Hybrid:**
- Hybrid: 2 Focus → 3 tokens + 2 progress

This adjustment makes the Hybrid provide more tokens than separate actions would net you, creating a meaningful tradeoff between immediate progress (separate actions) and token accumulation (hybrid approach).

**Target Threshold Adjustment:**
Based on my simulations showing 12-15 progress as typical outcomes, I recommend setting encounter targets at:
- Basic Success: 10 progress
- Good Success: 14 progress  
- Excellent Success: 18 progress

These thresholds ensure that solid play achieves basic success, optimal play reaches good success, and excellent success requires either perfect execution or creative risk-taking.

**Generation B Strategic Purpose:**
Rather than change Generation B's efficiency, I suggest viewing it as the "precision option" - when you need exactly 2 tokens for a specific conversion, or when you want to conserve Focus for other high-value actions. This mirrors how Splendor's cheap cards serve specific strategic niches rather than general efficiency.

## Strategic Validation Summary

These refined values successfully create the Splendor-style progression you requested. Players can see exactly what options will be available in future stages, enabling the forward-planning satisfaction that makes Splendor compelling. The tier structure rewards engine-building while keeping all strategic approaches viable, and the immediate penalty system maintains pressure without complex state tracking.

The mathematical relationships ensure that different strategies achieve similar total progress through different risk and timing profiles, creating the meaningful strategic choice diversity that defines excellent game design.
