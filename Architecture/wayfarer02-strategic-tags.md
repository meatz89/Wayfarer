# Wayfarer Strategic Tags: Complete Reference

## Introduction

Strategic tags are location-specific elements that are always active and define how approach tag values affect momentum and pressure. Each location defines 4 strategic tags (one per approach), leaving the fifth approach neutral. This document details all 20 possible strategic tags (5 approaches × 4 effect types), providing thematic names and descriptions for each.

Strategic tag effects scale with the related approach tag value, creating stronger effects as players invest more in specific approaches.

- **Ideal Locations**: Puzzles, research, investigations, planning sessions

### 10. "Calculated Response" (Analysis → Decreases Pressure)
- **Effect**: Reduces pressure proportional to Analysis value
- **Scaling**: -1 pressure per 2 points in Analysis
- **Description**: Your thoughtful approach anticipates and prevents complications before they arise. Careful planning reduces risks and pressure.
- **Ideal Locations**: Complex systems, trap-filled areas, strategic planning

### 11. "Overthinking" (Analysis → Decreases Momentum)
- **Effect**: Reduces momentum proportional to Analysis value
- **Scaling**: -1 momentum per 2 points in Analysis
- **Description**: Your analytical approach leads to paralysis by analysis. You're so caught up in examining possibilities that you struggle to make actual progress.
- **Ideal Locations**: Time-sensitive situations, instinctive challenges, combat

### 12. "Analytical Anxiety" (Analysis → Increases Pressure)
- **Effect**: Adds pressure proportional to Analysis value
- **Scaling**: +1 pressure per 2 points in Analysis
- **Description**: Your overanalysis reveals all possible failure points, increasing your stress and pressure. The more you analyze, the more problems you identify.
- **Ideal Locations**: Chaotic environments, social situations requiring spontaneity

## Precision-Based Strategic Tags

### 13. "Masterful Execution" (Precision → Increases Momentum)
- **Effect**: Adds momentum proportional to Precision value
- **Scaling**: +1 momentum per 2 points in Precision
- **Description**: Your precise approach eliminates wasted effort and maximizes effectiveness. Every action brings you closer to your goal with minimal waste.
- **Ideal Locations**: Crafting, physical performances, ranged combat, surgery

### 14. "Careful Positioning" (Precision → Decreases Pressure)
- **Effect**: Reduces pressure proportional to Precision value
- **Scaling**: -1 pressure per 2 points in Precision
- **Description**: Your precise movements and careful approach reduce the risk of errors and complications. Precision helps avoid potential problems.
- **Ideal Locations**: Dangerous environments, disarming traps, delicate negotiations

### 15. "Rigid Methodology" (Precision → Decreases Momentum)
- **Effect**: Reduces momentum proportional to Precision value
- **Scaling**: -1 momentum per 2 points in Precision
- **Description**: Your precise approach is too methodical for this situation. The need for exactness slows your progress when flexibility would serve better.
- **Ideal Locations**: Chaotic environments, rapidly changing situations, improvisation requirements

### 16. "Perfectionist Pressure" (Precision → Increases Pressure)
- **Effect**: Adds pressure proportional to Precision value
- **Scaling**: +1 pressure per 2 points in Precision
- **Description**: Your precise approach creates additional pressure as you strive for perfection in a situation that doesn't require it. The perfect becomes the enemy of the good.
- **Ideal Locations**: Time-limited challenges, artistic expression, spontaneous situations

## Implementation Notes

### Location Design
- Each location should include 4 strategic tags that create a coherent strategic landscape
- Typically includes:
  - Two beneficial tags (momentum increase, pressure decrease) for favored approaches
  - Two detrimental tags (momentum decrease, pressure increase) for disfavored approaches
  - One neutral approach with no associated tag

### Effect Scaling
- Strategic tag effects typically scale at a rate of 1 effect point per 2 approach points
- This creates meaningful progression as players invest in specific approaches
- Advanced locations might use different scaling ratios for increased challenge

### Strategic Implications
- Players should identify which approaches are beneficial for each location and focus on building those tags
- Managing detrimental approach tags is equally important to avoid negative effects
- The neutral approach provides a safe option with no benefits or penalties
- Strategic tags create natural affinities for certain character archetypes in different locations

### Narrative Integration
- Strategic tag effects should be explained through narrative outcomes
- For example, when "Overwhelming Force" provides momentum: *"Your powerful display intimidates your opponent, creating an opening you can exploit."*
- When "Social Awkwardness" increases pressure: *"Your attempt at friendliness seems out of place here, attracting unwanted attention."*
