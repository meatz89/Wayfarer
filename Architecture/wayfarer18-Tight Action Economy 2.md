Crafting a Tight, Context-Sensitive, Approach-Based Action Economy for Wayfarer
I. Introduction: Refining Wayfarer's Core Mechanics

Building upon the foundation of a text-based visual novel/RPG hybrid, "Wayfarer" will center its gameplay around a tight, context-sensitive, and approach-based action economy. Eschewing traditional combat and crafting systems, the core experience will revolve around strategic decision-making within narrative encounters. The player character, defined by one of six archetypes, will navigate the world using a finite pool of "Personal Effort" each day. The primary constraint on the player's actions will be their limited inventory space, requiring careful consideration of what to carry to efficiently tackle various challenges. This system will emphasize flat, stacking bonuses derived from location familiarity, character relationships, and the player's chosen archetype and skills within it. Encounters will be approached through Physical, Social, or Intellectual actions, each offering different benefits and contributing to the player's narrative progression via a choice-based system. Penalties for failing to meet basic needs will be flat and directly impact the player's "Personal Effort." The goal is to create a deeply satisfying gameplay loop focused on strategic choices and narrative consequences, independent of traditional progression systems.

II. Core Principles: Effort, Inventory, and Approach

The action economy of "Wayfarer" will be built upon three interconnected pillars:

Personal Effort: This represents the player character's daily capacity for action. A fixed number of "Effort" points are available each day, acting as the primary resource to be managed. The cost of actions will vary based on their complexity and the player's proficiency.
Strategic Inventory: Limited inventory slots will dictate the tools and resources the player can readily access. Certain actions will require specific items to be present in the inventory for efficient execution, creating a strategic layer to inventory management.
Approach-Based Actions: Every encounter can be approached using one of three methods:
Physical: Actions relying on Force or Precision.
Social: Actions focused on Persuasion or Rapport.
Intellectual: Actions utilizing Observation or Contemplation.
The player's chosen archetype will heavily influence their proficiency in these approaches and unlock unique action options within each.

III. Implementing the Tight Action Economy

Each day, the player begins with a set amount of "Personal Effort" (e.g., 4 points, mirroring "Dotage"). Every action taken will cost a specific amount of "Effort," reflecting its intensity and complexity.

Base Action Cost: Most basic interactions and choices within an encounter will cost 1 "Effort" point. This could include making a simple observation, attempting a basic persuasive line, or trying a straightforward physical solution.
Archetype-Specific Actions: Each archetype will have access to more specialized actions that might cost 2 or more "Effort" points but offer greater potential for success or unique outcomes. For example, the Artisan might use 2 "Effort" to "Assess Materials" in the environment for hidden opportunities, while the Shadow might spend 2 "Effort" to "Observe Inconspicuously" for crucial information.
Inventory-Dependent Actions: Certain actions will have a reduced "Effort" cost or become available only if specific items are in the player's inventory. For instance, attempting to "Scale a Wall" (Physical - Precision) might cost 2 "Effort" normally, but only 1 "Effort" if the player has a "Rope" in their inventory. Similarly, a "Scribe" might be able to "Decipher Ancient Text" (Intellectual - Contemplation) for 1 "Effort" with "Ink and Parchment," but be unable to attempt it without these tools.   
Contextual Bonuses Affecting Effort Cost: Contextual flat bonuses from location familiarity, relationships, and skills can reduce the "Effort" cost of actions. For example, if the player has a high familiarity with a "Local Tavern," attempting to "Gather Information" (Social - Rapport) there might cost 1 less "Effort" point. A strong relationship with a "Local Merchant" might reduce the "Effort" required for "Bartering" (Social - Persuasion).
IV. Context-Sensitive, Approach-Based Actions

Every encounter will present a situation that can be tackled using different approaches aligned with the player's chosen archetype and their strengths.

Physical Encounters:
Force: The Shadow archetype might have an action to "Intimidate with Force" (costing 2 Effort), while the Courtier might "Use Royal Authority" (costing 1 Effort, requires specific social standing points).
Precision: The Herbalist might "Carefully Examine Tracks" (costing 1 Effort, bonus in familiar locations), while the Artisan could "Disable a Trap with Dexterity" (costing 2 Effort, requires specific tools).
Social Encounters:
Persuasion: The Merchant might "Offer a Lucrative Deal" (costing 2 Effort, requires specific inventory), while the Courtier could "Employ Diplomatic Language" (costing 1 Effort, bonus with high Rapport points).
Rapport: The Scribe might "Share Knowledge to Build Trust" (costing 1 Effort, bonus with related intellectual points), while the Herbalist could "Offer Aid and Comfort" (costing 1 Effort, bonus with high relationship level).
Intellectual Encounters:
Observation: The Shadow might "Notice Subtle Details" (costing 1 Effort, bonus in familiar locations), while the Artisan could "Analyze Structural Weakness" (costing 2 Effort, requires specific tools).
Contemplation: The Scribe might "Recall Historical Precedent" (costing 1 Effort, bonus with relevant knowledge points), while the Herbalist could "Identify Medicinal Properties" (costing 2 Effort, requires specific inventory).
Each action will have a clear category (Physical, Social, Intellectual) and an associated approach (Force/Precision, Persuasion/Rapport, Observation/Contemplation). The success of these actions will be determined by the player's accumulated points in the relevant archetype categories, as in "The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante."

V. Inventory Integration

Limited inventory space will be crucial for this system. The player will have a finite number of slots (e.g., 5-7 initially).

Action Enablers: As mentioned, some actions will require specific items in the inventory to be performed efficiently or at all. The absence of a "Rope" might prevent scaling a wall, or lacking "Ink and Parchment" might block deciphering text.   
Strategic Choices: Players must constantly decide what to carry based on their anticipated needs for the day. Will they prioritize tools for physical challenges, items for social interactions (like gifts), or resources for intellectual pursuits (like books or notes)?
Contextual Inventory Bonuses: Certain inventory items might provide flat bonuses to specific types of actions in certain contexts. For example, carrying "Local Maps" might grant a flat bonus to "Navigation" (Physical - Precision) in unfamiliar areas.
VI. Contextual Flat Bonuses

Bonuses will be applied based on:

Location Familiarity: Spending more time in a location grants flat bonuses to actions performed there.   
Character Relationships: Positive relationships with NPCs provide flat bonuses to Social actions involving them.   
Skills: As the player makes choices, they gain points in skills. Reaching certain point thresholds in these skills will grant flat bonuses to related actions.   
These bonuses will stack, encouraging specialization and engagement with the game world.

VII. Consequences of Unmet Needs

Failing to meet basic needs will result in flat penalties to "Personal Effort":

Food: For each point of missing food, the player loses 1 point of "Personal Effort" the next day [User Query].
Water: Lack of sufficient water reduces the "energy" regeneration rate by a flat amount.
Rest: Insufficient rest temporarily decreases the maximum "Personal Effort" available by a flat amount.
These penalties create constant pressure and necessitate careful resource management.

VIII. Satisfaction Without Progression

The core gameplay loop of making strategic choices within the constraints of "Personal Effort," inventory, and narrative progression will provide inherent satisfaction. Short-term goals and achievements tied to successfully navigating encounters, building relationships, and managing resources will offer a sense of accomplishment without relying on traditional leveling. The emergent optimization puzzle of finding the most effective approach to each situation will be a key driver of player engagement.   

IX. Conclusion: A Tight and Engaging System

By focusing on a finite action economy, strategic inventory management, context-sensitive bonuses, and approach-based actions tied to player archetypes and a choice-driven narrative, "Wayfarer" can create a tight and engaging gameplay experience. The absence of crafting will streamline the resource management, while the emphasis on flat, stacking bonuses will reward player specialization and interaction with the game world. This system aims to provide a satisfying and challenging experience centered on thoughtful decision-making and narrative consequences.
