## Implementation Notes

### Location Design
- Each location should include 2-3 narrative tags that create meaningful challenges
- Tags should be thematically appropriate to the location
- Activation thresholds can be adjusted based on location difficulty

### Narrative Integration
- When a narrative tag activates, the Narrative AI Layer should explain the effect in thematic terms
- For example, when "Battle Rage" activates: *"Your blood pumps with adrenaline as you focus on the threat before you. Complex information seems irrelevant in the heat of battle."*

### Strategic Implications
- Players must be mindful of which approach tags they increase to avoid activating detrimental narrative tags
- Sometimes activating a narrative tag is worth the strategic advantage of increasing a beneficial approach
- The narrative tag system creates interesting trade-offs between immediate benefits and strategic limitations
