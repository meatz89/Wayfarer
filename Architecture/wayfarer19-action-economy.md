Refining Wayfarer's Action Economy: A Proposal for Tension and Interconnection
1. Introduction
Purpose: This report presents a proposal for refining the action economy of the game "Wayfarer." The primary objective is to develop a tighter, more interconnected system that effectively generates tension for the player. This design draws inspiration from the successful mechanics observed in the game "Dotage," specifically its methods for creating pressure through scarcity and interlocking systems. However, these principles are adapted here to suit Wayfarer's distinct gameplay focus, which emphasizes exploration, investigation, and social interaction within a medieval town setting, rather than Dotage's focus on village building, crafting, and resource production.

Problem Statement: The current action economy in Wayfarer may lack the desired level of strategic depth or fail to create compelling pressure. Actions might feel disconnected, choices may lack significant consequence, or the overall system might not sufficiently engage the player in managing limited resources against mounting challenges. A refined system is needed to foster more meaningful decision-making and enhance player investment through tension and consequence.

Approach: The methodology employed involves analyzing the relevant systems of "Dotage" to identify the core principles behind its tension and interconnectedness. These principles are then translated and adapted into design pillars suitable for Wayfarer's thematic and mechanical context. Based on these pillars, a core action economy structure utilizing Action Points (AP) and abstract resources is proposed, accompanied by illustrative examples of core actions relevant to Wayfarer's likely gameplay loop within a medieval town. Finally, the report details how this proposed system generates tension and utilizes interlocking mechanics to achieve the project's goals.   

Report Structure Overview: The report begins by deconstructing the relevant mechanics of Dotage. It then establishes specific design pillars for Wayfarer's action economy. Following this, a detailed proposal for the core action economy is presented, including structure, resources, and sample actions. The subsequent section explains how this system generates tension and fosters interconnection. The report concludes with a summary and recommendations for further development and testing.

2. Deconstructing Dotage: Sources of Tension and Interconnection
An analysis of "Dotage" reveals several key mechanics that contribute to its characteristic tension and tightly interwoven gameplay, providing valuable lessons for Wayfarer's design.

Core Mechanic: Worker Placement as Action Scarcity:
Dotage utilizes a worker placement system where players assign villagers, called "Pips," to various tasks each turn. The limited number of Pips available acts as the primary form of action currency. Players cannot perform every desired or necessary task simultaneously, forcing them to make difficult choices about resource allocation and task prioritization. This inherent scarcity is the foundation of Dotage's turn-by-turn tactical depth. Dotage achieves action scarcity through its literal assignment of 'Pips' or workers. Each assigned Pip represents a committed action, making the limited pool of villagers the core constraint driving prioritization. While Wayfarer lacks this literal workforce for its primary activities (exploration, investigation), the underlying principle – a finite pool of 'action potential' per turn – remains a powerful mechanism for creating meaningful choices. Translating this requires an equivalent abstract limiter on the number or scope of actions a player can take within a given timeframe.   

Turn-Based Structure & Pacing:
The game operates on a turn-based structure, typically representing days. This allows players the necessary time to analyze the situation, plan their actions, and manage the game's complexity without real-time pressure. However, the act of passing the turn signifies commitment to the chosen actions and inexorably advances the game state. This progression includes the potential triggering of negative events and the consumption of resources, creating a deliberate cycle. This cycle involves planning under constraints, committing actions, and then evaluating the consequences as the game state evolves, which is fundamental to strategic gameplay and building tension. Wayfarer can adopt a similar turn or day-based structure to impose this methodical pressure.   

Interlocking Systems & Resource Loops:
Dotage features deeply interconnected systems. Basic survival needs like food, housing, and heat are linked; failure to manage one resource often negatively impacts others. For instance, insufficient food production can lead to hunger, which in turn increases the village's Fear level, potentially triggering further negative events. The game involves implicit production chains where raw resources are gathered, processed into goods, used to construct or upgrade buildings, train professionals, and enable more complex actions. Actions are rarely isolated; they enable, require, or modify subsequent possibilities. Furthermore, the "Memories" system, acting as a research or unlock mechanism, introduces new buildings, professions, and game mechanics across multiple playthroughs, progressively adding layers of complexity and reinforcing the need to understand systemic interactions.   

Generating Tension: Domains, Events, and Ailments:
Tension in Dotage arises not from direct conflict, which is intentionally absent , but from the relentless pressure exerted by its interconnected systems and external events. The game features "Domains" – abstract forces like Health/Sickness, Hope/Fear, Heat/Cold, and Nature/Cataclysm – that act as gauges of the village's vulnerability. Events, often referred to as "Dooms" or "Omens," are triggered periodically, influenced by the state of these Domains and the passage of time. These events escalate in severity, forcing players into reactive gameplay loops where they must expend precious actions and resources to mitigate negative outcomes. Ailments affecting individual Pips further strain the action economy by reducing workforce efficiency. The constant threat of cascading failure, where a shortfall in one area like food can trigger a 'death spiral' by impacting others like Fear , forces players into a state of precarious balance. This model of generating tension through systemic fragility and resource management aligns well with Wayfarer's non-combat focus, suggesting that pressure can be effectively created through managing abstract threats and consequences rather than direct confrontation.   

Roguelite Structure & Learning:
Dotage's roguelite structure, featuring perma-failure states and unlockable content ("Memories") between runs, incentivizes players to learn the intricacies of its systems. Success requires understanding the interconnectedness of actions, resources, and external pressures, encouraging adaptation and strategic refinement over multiple playthroughs. This reinforces the importance of designing systems that reward player understanding and mastery.   

3. Design Pillars for Wayfarer's Action Economy
Based on the analysis of Dotage and considering Wayfarer's unique focus, the following design pillars are proposed to guide the refinement of its action economy:

Pillar 1: Action Scarcity and Opportunity Cost:
The fundamental principle is that player actions within a given timeframe (e.g., a day or turn) must be limited. This scarcity, mirroring the limitation imposed by the number of Pips in Dotage , ensures that every action taken comes at the cost of not taking another potential action. This inherent opportunity cost is the primary driver of meaningful strategic decision-making. Limiting resources, including the capacity to act, increases their perceived value and forces players to prioritize, aligning with psychological principles of engagement through scarcity.   

Pillar 2: Interconnected Actions and Consequences:
Actions should not exist in isolation but form chains of cause and effect. Performing one action should frequently enable, require, modify, or preclude other actions. For example, successfully 'Gathering Rumors' might unlock specific 'Investigate Location' options, while failing a social interaction could block future 'Seek Audience' attempts with that NPC. Consequences must ripple through the game's systems. An action might consume one resource (like Time or Focus) while generating another (like Suspicion or a new Lead), directly impacting the player's future choices and the state of the game world. This mirrors the cascading effects observed in Dotage, where imbalances propagate through connected systems.   

Pillar 3: Managing Abstract Resources:
Given Wayfarer's focus on exploration, investigation, and social interaction rather than material crafting or trading, the core resources managed through the action economy should be primarily abstract and narrative-focused. Key resources could include:

Time: The primary constraint, managed through the turn structure and action costs.
Focus/Stamina: An expendable pool representing mental or physical exertion, limiting the number of demanding actions possible per day. This concept draws inspiration from mechanics like stamina bars or action-costing HP found in various RPGs.   
Social Standing/Reputation: A measure of the player's status and relationships within the town's social hierarchy. This resource would gate access to certain NPCs, information, locations, or actions, and be influenced by social interactions and public deeds.   
Suspicion/Heat: A negative resource accumulating through risky, illegal, or socially unacceptable actions. High levels would trigger negative consequences, such as increased attention from town guards or distrust from NPCs, analogous to the negative pressures from Dotage's Domains.   
Information Fragments/Leads: Discrete units of knowledge gathered through investigation or interaction, acting as keys to unlock further investigative actions or dialogue options. Managing these intangible resources aligns with principles of designing game economies around non-physical goods  and resonates with narrative resource mechanics like the "Willpower" system in "The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante," which gates choices based on an abstract resource representing inner resolve.   
Pillar 4: Systemic Pressure and Tension:
To emulate the tension generated by Dotage's Domains and Events , Wayfarer should incorporate background systems that exert pressure on the player. These systems should react to player actions and the passage of time, creating a dynamic environment. Examples relevant to a medieval town setting include fluctuating Town Guard alertness levels , shifting levels of community unrest or stability, deadlines associated with investigations, evolving NPC attitudes based on player reputation and actions, and seasonal effects impacting travel or opportunities. Tension arises naturally from the player needing to balance proactive goals (e.g., pursuing an investigation) against reactive needs (e.g., managing rising Suspicion or dealing with a sudden town event) using their limited actions. This leverages psychological principles of engagement through pressure, risk assessment, and the anticipation of consequences.   

Pillar 5: Clear Feedback and Readability:
For players to make informed strategic decisions within a complex, interconnected system, clear feedback is essential. The interface must effectively communicate the costs (AP, Focus, etc.) and potential outcomes (resource changes, Suspicion gain, etc.) of actions. Current levels of all managed resources and the status of background pressure systems (like Town Watch Alertness) must be readily accessible and understandable. Just as Dotage telegraphs its impending threats , Wayfarer must provide clear indicators of rising pressures and potential consequences, allowing players to anticipate challenges and plan accordingly.   

4. Wayfarer Core Action Economy Proposal
Based on the established design pillars, the following core action economy structure is proposed for Wayfarer:

Structure: Time-Based Action Points (AP)
The proposed system utilizes Action Points (AP) allocated per unit of time, specifically, per "Day" (representing a single turn). Players would receive a fixed pool of AP (e.g., 3 to 5 AP) at the beginning of each Day. This AP pool represents the player's capacity for significant action within that timeframe.

This AP structure offers greater flexibility compared to rigid action categories (like Dungeons & Dragons' Standard/Move/Bonus action system). Players can choose to spend their AP on a single, high-cost action or multiple lower-cost actions, allowing for varied tactical approaches suitable for investigative and social gameplay. Tying the AP refresh to the Day cycle reinforces Time as a critical, finite resource. Actions would cost 1 or more AP, depending on their complexity and impact. Some very simple interactions might be designated as "free" actions (costing 0 AP but potentially consuming narrative time). The handling of unspent AP requires careful balancing – they could be lost at the end of the Day to maintain pressure, or a limited number might carry over to provide some flexibility.   

Core Managed Resources (Detailing Pillar 3):
The action economy revolves around the management of several key abstract resources:

Time: Primarily managed implicitly through the Day/Turn structure and the AP cost of actions. Specific actions might also advance the clock significantly within a Day (e.g., extended travel, lengthy research).
Focus: A numerical pool (e.g., starting at 10 points) representing mental energy or concentration. This resource is expended when performing demanding actions such as Deep Investigation, Deciphering Complex Clues, or Intense Social Negotiation. Focus would likely regenerate through a dedicated 'Rest' action or perhaps slowly over time. Depleting Focus could impose penalties on subsequent actions (e.g., increased failure chance, higher AP cost) or temporarily lock access to Focus-intensive actions.   
Social Standing: A quantifiable rating (e.g., a numerical scale or descriptive tiers like 'Respected,' 'Neutral,' 'Suspicious') reflecting the player's reputation and influence within the town's social structure. This resource is modified by social interactions (successful persuasion, public faux pas, associating with certain factions), completing tasks for influential figures, or performing actions like 'Bribing an Official' or 'Attending a Social Event'. High Social Standing unlocks opportunities (e.g., audiences with nobles, access to restricted guilds or locations), while low standing can close doors, attract negative attention, or make NPCs uncooperative.   
Suspicion: A numerical rating representing the degree to which the player has attracted unwanted attention from authorities or suspicious elements. This increases through illegal activities (theft, trespassing), being observed in restricted areas, asking sensitive questions, failing social checks related to deception, or being associated with known troublemakers. High Suspicion levels would trigger negative events or systemic changes, such as increased Guard patrols targeting the player, NPCs refusing to interact, or being actively followed. Actions like 'Lay Low' or perhaps successful deception could reduce Suspicion over time. This functions as a key pressure mechanic, similar to Dotage's negative Domain effects.   
Leads: Discrete, named pieces of information acquired through actions like 'Gather Rumors' or 'Investigate Location' (e.g., "Lead: Merchant Guild smuggling route," "Lead: Alchemist's unusual purchases"). These act as consumable resources that enable specific follow-up actions ('Pursue Lead'), dialogue options, or grant access to new locations relevant to an investigation.
Core Set of Actions (Illustrative Examples):
The following table outlines a core set of actions designed for Wayfarer's non-crafting/non-trading focus, integrating elements of medieval town life derived from historical context and fitting the proposed AP and resource system. These examples are illustrative and would require expansion and balancing.

Table 1: Wayfarer Core Action Set

Action Name	AP Cost	Other Costs	Primary Effect	Secondary Effects / Interconnections	Relevant Context Snippets
Gather Rumors (Inn/Market)	1	Low Focus	Gain 1-2 general Leads OR update existing Lead status	+/- Social Standing (method), small chance +Suspicion	
Consult Notice Board	1	None	Gain public Leads, learn town events/regulations	None	
Investigate Location	2	Moderate Focus	Search area for clues, potentially gain specific Leads/Items	+Suspicion if trespassing/observed	
Pursue Lead	1-2	Consumes 1 Lead, variable Focus	Progress investigation; gain new Leads, encounters, location access	May +Suspicion, may require Social Standing check	
Seek Audience (Official/Noble)	2	Requires Min. Social Standing, potential Bribe	Attempt to gain info, favor, access	Outcome affects Social Standing, high chance +Suspicion if sensitive	
Spread Rumor/Disinformation	1	Low Focus, +/- Social Standing	Attempt to influence NPC opinion / distract authorities	Risk of backfire (-Social Standing, +Suspicion)	
Lay Low	1	None	Reduce Suspicion over time, forgo other actions	Consumes time effectively	
Travel (Within Town/Region)	1+	None	Move character between zones/locations	May trigger encounters, consumes time, affected by weather/season/unrest	
Rest	1	None	Recover Focus pool	Consumes significant time within the Day	
  
Action Interconnection Example Flow:
Consider this sequence: The player uses Gather Rumors (1 AP, Low Focus) at a local Inn , a known hub for information. This yields a "Lead: Guard Captain seen arguing near East Gate." To follow up, the player uses Pursue Lead (1 AP, Moderate Focus), traveling to the East Gate and observing. This reveals a dropped insignia, generating a new Lead or Item. Now, wanting to confront the Captain directly, the player considers Seek Audience (2 AP). However, this action might require a certain level of Social Standing or risk a significant increase in Suspicion if the Captain is questioned aggressively about the argument. An alternative path could be using Spread Rumor (1 AP, Low Focus) about the argument, hoping to gauge public reaction or distract the Captain, but this carries the risk of backfiring and increasing the player's own Suspicion or damaging their Social Standing if the source is traced back. Each choice consumes limited AP and interacts with the abstract resource systems, creating a web of interconnected possibilities and consequences.   

5. Generating Tension and Interlocking Systems in Wayfarer
The proposed action economy is designed to generate tension and foster interlocking systems through several mechanisms, drawing parallels with Dotage's approach but tailored to Wayfarer's context.

Sources of Tension:

Opportunity Cost: The fixed AP pool per Day forces constant trade-offs. Choosing to spend 2 AP on 'Investigate Location' means the player cannot also 'Gather Rumors' (1 AP) and 'Lay Low' (1 AP) within the same Day if they only have 3 AP. This scarcity compels players to prioritize and weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of each available action against the actions they must forgo.   
Resource Depletion: Managing the abstract resources creates ongoing pressure. Running low on Focus restricts the use of powerful investigative or social actions when they might be most needed. Depleting Social Standing through failed interactions or necessary but unpopular actions can lock off crucial pathways or allies. Leads may become outdated or irrelevant if not pursued promptly due to the passage of time (implicitly managed by AP expenditure). This mirrors the psychological impact of resource scarcity, where dwindling supplies increase anxiety and the stakes of decisions.   
Risk vs. Reward: Many actions involve inherent risks. A risky investigation might yield critical clues but carries a high chance of increasing Suspicion. Attempting to bribe an official might grant access but could fail, damaging Social Standing and potentially increasing Suspicion. Players must constantly evaluate whether the potential reward justifies the risk and the expenditure of limited resources like AP and Focus.   
Escalating Threats: Tension escalates over time through the consequences of player actions and the progression of background systems. Rising Suspicion doesn't just impose a static penalty; it actively triggers more dangerous events or systemic responses (e.g., more frequent Guard patrols). Failing to maintain Social Standing can lead to social isolation, making information gathering harder. Unresolved plot threads or investigations might lead to worsening situations in the game world (e.g., a conspiracy advancing, a threat growing stronger). This dynamic escalation adapts the principle behind Dotage's increasingly challenging Domains and Events.   
Wayfarer's "Domain" Equivalents (Systemic Pressures):
To create ambient, evolving pressure similar to Dotage's Domains, Wayfarer can implement background systems that dynamically react to player actions and the passage of time:

Town Watch Alertness: This system tracks the general level of vigilance and suspicion among the town's guards. It would be influenced directly by the player's cumulative Suspicion score, recent public disturbances (potentially caused by the player or external events), the time of day (night patrols might be more common), and possibly seasonal events or specific plot developments. Higher Alertness levels would translate into tangible gameplay effects: more frequent and observant guard patrols, stricter checks at town gates or restricted areas, NPCs becoming more reluctant to share sensitive information, and potentially higher AP costs or failure rates for stealth-related actions.   
Community Stability/Unrest: This system reflects the overall mood and orderliness of the town's populace. It could be influenced by major plot events, the player's public actions (e.g., resolving a major crisis vs. inciting conflict, spreading destabilizing rumors), perceived economic conditions (abstracted), or factional tensions. High Unrest might lead to riots, curfews limiting movement, increased factional hostility making certain areas dangerous, or NPCs being preoccupied with their own safety, affecting interaction possibilities. Conversely, high Stability might make certain actions easier or open up unique opportunities.
Information Network: This system represents the speed and reach with which information – including rumors about the player – circulates within the town. It could be influenced by the player's Social Standing (well-connected players might hear things faster but also be gossiped about more), the nature of their actions (public actions spread faster than private ones), the density of social hubs like inns and markets , and the passage of time. This system affects how quickly the player's Suspicion level impacts NPC attitudes across town, how long specific Leads remain relevant before going cold, and the potential for misinformation (spread by the player or others) to take root.   
These background systems function as dynamic feedback loops. Player actions (e.g., performing a public, suspicious act) feed into these systems (increasing Suspicion, potentially lowering Stability, raising Alertness). The changing state of these systems then modifies the context for future player actions (making travel riskier, social interactions more difficult). This creates the desired interlocking effect, where the player's choices constantly shape and are shaped by the evolving state of the game world, generating organic tension and consequence. This mirrors how Dotage's Domains provide passive, escalating pressure that interacts directly with the player's core resource management loop.   

Example of Interlocking Systems at Play:
Imagine a player performs a risky 'Investigate Location' action (costing 2 AP and Moderate Focus) at night, successfully finding a clue but being spotted, thus increasing their Suspicion score. This rise in Suspicion contributes to an increase in the 'Town Watch Alertness' level overnight. The next Day, the player plans to travel across town ('Travel' action, 1 AP). Due to the heightened Alertness, this action now carries a higher risk of encountering a guard patrol, potentially leading to questioning (a social check) or further Suspicion gain. Simultaneously, perhaps an unrelated town event or a previous player action ('Spread Rumor') has increased the 'Community Unrest' level. When the player attempts to 'Gather Rumors' (1 AP) at the market, they find NPCs are more guarded and less willing to talk due to the general tension, requiring a higher Social Standing check or yielding less useful information. Faced with rising Alertness and wary NPCs, the player might choose to 'Lay Low' (1 AP). This action effectively consumes an AP slot that could have been used for investigation, potentially allowing a time-sensitive Lead to expire due to the 'Information Network' effect, while only slowly reducing the accumulated Suspicion. This chain of events illustrates how actions, resources (AP, Focus, Suspicion, Social Standing, Leads), and background systems constantly interact, forcing players to make difficult choices with cascading consequences.

6. Conclusion & Recommendations
Summary of Proposal:
This report proposes refining Wayfarer's action economy by implementing a system based on Action Points (AP) allocated per Day. This system governs player actions focused on exploration, investigation, and social interaction. Core gameplay revolves around managing abstract resources: Time (implicit via AP and turns), Focus (for demanding actions), Social Standing (gating social interactions), Suspicion (tracking unwanted attention), and Leads (driving investigation). These resources are spent and gained through a core set of actions themed around medieval town life. Tension is generated through AP scarcity, resource management trade-offs, risk/reward calculations, and escalating systemic pressures modeled by background systems like Town Watch Alertness, Community Stability, and the Information Network.

Alignment with Goals:
The proposed AP-based system directly addresses the goal of creating a tighter action economy through the explicit limitation of actions per Day and the costs associated with performing them. It fosters interconnection by linking actions to the gain and loss of abstract resources, which in turn influence the availability and outcomes of future actions and interact with dynamic background systems. Tension is generated through the constant pressure of opportunity costs, resource depletion risks, and the escalating threats posed by rising Suspicion and evolving systemic pressures. This approach successfully adapts the core principles of tension and interconnection observed in Dotage  – scarcity forcing choice, cascading consequences, and external pressures – to Wayfarer's distinct non-crafting, non-trading gameplay loop.   

Strengths:
The proposed system offers significant flexibility within each turn, allowing players to tailor their actions to the situation. It strongly supports Wayfarer's apparent focus on non-combat gameplay pillars like investigation and social maneuvering. The interaction between player actions, abstract resources, and reactive background systems holds strong potential for emergent narrative and gameplay, where players experience unique consequences based on their specific choices and the evolving state of the world. Furthermore, the actions and resources are thematically grounded in the likely medieval town setting, drawing on historical context regarding town life, social structures, and information flow.
