## Testing Philosophy (PLAYTEST_GUIDE.md)

**Strategic Testing (What We're Doing):**
- Cumulative patterns over hours
- Emotional arc validation
- "Seeing the life I could have had" (Sir Brante model)
- Stat specialization creating distinct experiences

**NOT Tactical Testing:**
- Individual choice difficulty
- Moment-to-moment challenge balance
- Single-scene completion

## Final Emotional Arc Assessment

**To be completed after 4 hours**

### Key Questions:
1. Did I feel like I was building an identity through choices?
2. Did specialization create a distinct experience?
3. Did I see paths I couldn't take due to stat gating?
4. Did I feel regret about the "life I could have had"?
5. Would a different build feel meaningfully different?

### Pass/Fail Criteria:
- ✅ PASS: Strong emotional arc, clear regret about alternate paths, specialization matters
- ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some emotional arc but weak regret or unclear specialization
- ❌ FAIL: No emotional arc, choices feel interchangeable, stats don't matter
