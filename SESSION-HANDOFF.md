- ✅ **ContractPipeline_TravelBasedContract_CompletesOnArrival**: PASSING
- ✅ **ContractPipeline_MultipleRequirements_TrackProgressIndependently**: PASSING
- ✅ **ContractPipeline_AlternativePath_StillCompletes**: PASSING (market availability issue resolved)

**✅ Market Availability Issue Resolution Complete**

**Issue Resolved**: Fixed market availability issue by setting correct time block in test setup.

**Root Cause**: The `ContractPipeline_AlternativePath_StillCompletes` test was running at Dawn time, but the NPCs with Trade services were configured with `Schedule.Market_Hours` (Morning + Afternoon only).

**Solution Implemented**: Updated the test to use `TimeBlocks.Morning` instead of the default Dawn time when creating the test scenario.

**Fix Applied**:
```csharp
TestScenarioBuilder scenario = new TestScenarioBuilder()
    .WithPlayer(p => p
        .StartAt("town_square")
        .WithCoins(100)
        .WithItem("herbs"))
    .WithTimeState(t => t
        .Day(1)
        .TimeBlock(TimeBlocks.Morning));  // Set to Morning when traders are available
```

**Result**: All 4 ContractPipelineIntegrationTests now pass successfully.

**System Integration Status**:
