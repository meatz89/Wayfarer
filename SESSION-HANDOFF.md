# SESSION HANDOFF: WAYFARER IMPLEMENTATION
**Session Date**: 2025-08-26 (Session 47 - POC FULL IMPLEMENTATION)  
**Status**: 🔧 IN PROGRESS - Comprehensive POC implementation underway
**Build Status**: ✅ Compiles and runs
**Branch**: letters-ledgers
**Port**: 5127 (ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://localhost:5127" dotnet run)

## ✅ SESSION 47 - POC IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS

### CORE MECHANICS FIXED (~70% Complete)

#### ✅ COMPLETED:
1. **Depth-Gated Card System** (CORE INNOVATION)
   - Changed from MinDepth 0-3 to Depth 0-20
   - CurrentComfort starts at 5 (not 0)
   - Filter: card.Depth <= CurrentComfort
   - Comfort gates card access continuously

2. **Emotional State Rules**
   - All 9 states have correct Listen/Speak mechanics
   - DESPERATE: Listen draws 2 + 1 crisis, state→HOSTILE
   - HOSTILE: Weight 0, only crisis cards playable
   - OPEN/CONNECTED: Check letter deck for eligible letters
   - Crisis cards cost 0 weight in DESPERATE

3. **Four-Deck Architecture**
   - Conversation Deck: Regular cards (depth 0-20)
   - Letter Deck: Letter negotiation cards
   - Crisis Deck: Crisis cards (injected in DESPERATE/HOSTILE)
   - Exchange Deck: Quick trade cards

4. **Letter Deck System**
   - Only checked in OPEN/CONNECTED states
   - Token requirements validate eligibility
   - Success/failure affects terms, not acquisition

#### ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING:
- **Patience Calculation**: Missing hunger modifier (-1 per 20 hunger)
- **Exchange System**: Not tested for 0 attention cost

#### ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED:
- **Token Effects**: No +5% success per token
- **Observation Decay**: Cards don't decay over time

### TEST RESULTS (Elena DESPERATE):
- ✅ Started in DESPERATE state
- ✅ Listen showed "Draw 2 + Crisis • State → Hostile"
- ✅ Crisis card appeared with 0 weight
- ✅ Comfort started at 5 ("Basic Trust")
- ✅ Weight limits correct (3 in DESPERATE, 0 in HOSTILE)

## ❌ SESSION 46 - SCREENSHOT VERIFICATION RESULTS

### WHAT WAS ATTEMPTED:
1. **❌ ATTENTION BASE 10**: Code changed but still shows 7/7 in UI
2. **❌ HUNGER +20/PERIOD**: Code added but not verified working
3. **⚠️ TRAVEL TIME**: Shows "15 minutes pass..." message but time stays at 06:00 AM
4. **❌ UI COMPLIANCE**: Resources still show letters (C, H, A) despite CSS fixes
5. **✅ TOAST NOTIFICATIONS**: Working correctly with X dismiss buttons

### VERIFIED WITH SCREENSHOTS:
- `initial-state-attention-7.png`: Shows attention as 7/7 instead of 10/10
- `after-fixes-still-broken.png`: Shows UI issues persist after fixes
- `travel-time-not-updating.png`: Shows "15 minutes pass..." but clock still at 06:00 AM

### PREVIOUSLY FIXED (Session 43):
1. **✅ STARTING ATTENTION**: Player starts with 5 attention
2. **✅ WORK ACTIONS**: Commercial spots offer "Work for Coins" (2 attention → 8 coins)
3. **✅ TAVERN REST**: "Rest at the Inn" exchange (5 coins → full attention)
4. **✅ EXCHANGE RESOURCES**: Fixed Stamina→Attention bug

## 🟡 SESSION 42 IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS

### WHAT I ACTUALLY FIXED
1. **✅ STAMINA → ATTENTION RESOURCE**
   - Changed ResourceType.Stamina to ResourceType.Attention in code
   - Exchange cards now reference Attention instead of Stamina
   - VERIFIED: Exchange UI shows "Attention +3"

2. **⚠️ EMOTIONAL STATES - PARTIALLY FIXED**
   - Added state transition cards at depth 0 
   - VERIFIED: Elena displays as DESPERATE
   - VERIFIED: Marcus displays as NEUTRAL  
   - NOT TESTED: Whether state transitions actually work in conversation
   - NOT TESTED: Special rules (EAGER bonus, CONNECTED auto-depth)
   - ASSUMPTION: Other 7 states work (but didn't actually test them)

3. **⚠️ MEDIEVAL UI - SOME PROGRESS**
   - VERIFIED: Dark header and parchment body colors applied
   - VERIFIED: Container width constrained
   - CLAIMED but NOT VERIFIED: Breadcrumbs working (agent said they added them)
   - FAILED: Icons still show as letters (C, H, A) not proper icons

4. **✅ EXCHANGE SYSTEM SIMPLIFIED**
   - Made exchanges always succeed (100% success rate)
   - VERIFIED: No success/failure shown for exchange cards
   - VERIFIED: Exchange completes and returns to location

## 📊 BRUTAL HONESTY - WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS

### ✅ DEFINITELY WORKING (Tested & Verified)
- **Build**: Compiles with warnings but runs
- **Basic Navigation**: Can click between Location/Queue/Travel screens
- **Exchange Cards**: Display as cards, use Attention not Stamina
- **Exchange Mechanics**: Always succeed, no random rolls
- **NPC State Display**: Shows "DESPERATE" and "NEUTRAL" on NPCs
- **Resources Bar**: Shows C:12 H:100 H:25 A:0/3
- **Some CSS**: Dark header, parchment body, 720px container

### ⚠️ PROBABLY WORKING (Code exists but not fully tested)
- **State Transitions**: Added cards but never tested if they work
- **Other 7 Emotional States**: Code is there but untested
- **Crisis Card Weight**: Shows 0 in desperate (code fixed, not tested)
- **Letter Generation**: Code updated to 10 comfort but can't test

### ❌ DEFINITELY BROKEN (Tested & Failed)
- **Observations**: ZERO observations appear anywhere
- **Work Actions**: Don't exist - can't earn coins
- **Tavern Rest**: No exchange for attention refresh
- **Starting Attention**: Player has 0, can't do anything
- **Crisis Conversations**: Can't test (no attention)
- **Icons**: Still letters (C, H, A) not medieval icons
- **Breadcrumbs**: Don't see them (agent claimed they work)
- **Meeting Obligations**: Not in UI (only deliveries show)

### 🤷 UNKNOWN (Can't test without attention)
- Do state transitions actually change states?
- Does EAGER give +3 comfort bonus?
- Does CONNECTED auto-advance depth?
- Does crisis card generate letter?
- Do observation cards enter hand?
- Does comfort threshold trigger letter?

## 🎯 PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED

### CRITICAL (Game-Breaking)
1. **❌ OBSERVATION SYSTEM NOT WORKING**
   - Core gameplay loop broken - can't gain conversation cards
   - "Guards blocking north road" should appear at Fountain
   - Without observations, players lack conversation ammunition
   
2. **❌ NO WAY TO GAIN ATTENTION**
   - Player starts with 0 attention
   - Need work actions or starting attention (3-5)
   - Blocks all conversation testing

### SOLUTIONS NEEDED:

**Attention System**:
- Option 1: Start player with 3-5 attention each morning
- Option 2: Work actions give coins → Tavern exchange: coins for attention (lodging/rest)
  - Work: 2 attention → 8 coins
  - Tavern: 5 coins → Rest → Full attention refresh
- Option 3: Crisis conversations cost 0 attention in emergency

**Observation System**:
- Must investigate why observations aren't displaying
- Check if ObservationManager is initialized
- Verify observations.json is being loaded
   
4. **Fix UI Styling**
   - Navigation buttons need flexible width
   - Conversation header needs styling
   - Obligations header needs padding
   - Apply medieval theme
   - Reduce main container width (cards too big)
   - Increase font size globally (text too small)
   - Remove Travel buttons from Obligation Queue
   - Add type/color coding for obligations

### MEDIUM (Polish)
5. **Test Core Features**
   - Letter generation at comfort 5, 10, 15, 20
   - Observation cards in conversation hand
   - Complete POC flow

## 🚀 QUICK START
```bash
cd /mnt/c/git/wayfarer/src
dotnet clean && dotnet build --no-incremental
ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://localhost:5005" dotnet run
```

## 📝 TESTING PERFORMED
1. ✅ Moved to Marcus's Stall
2. ✅ Started Quick Exchange - saw wrong resource (Stamina)
3. ✅ Started Standard Conversation - only NEUTRAL state works
4. ✅ Took observation - attention reduced from 3→2→1→0
5. ✅ Viewed Obligation Queue - works but ugly
6. ❌ Did not test other emotional states
7. ❌ Did not test letter generation
8. ❌ Did not test full POC flow

## 💀 REAL IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

**What percentage actually works: ~20-30%** (DOWN from previous estimate after screenshot verification)

The core data structures exist but the gameplay loop is completely broken:
- Can't get attention → Can't have conversations → Can't test anything
- Can't see observations → Can't get conversation cards
- Can't work → Can't earn coins → Can't buy rest

**The Truth**:
- I fixed some bugs (Stamina→Attention) 
- I added some code (state cards, UI colors)
- But I can't verify most of it works because the basic loop is broken
- Many "fixes" are untested assumptions

**Game Economy Loop (BROKEN)**:
1. ❌ Start with 0 attention (can't do anything)
2. ❌ No work actions (can't earn coins)
3. ❌ No tavern rest (can't get attention)
4. ❌ No observations (can't get cards)
5. ❌ Can't test conversations or letters

### CRITICAL BUGS VERIFIED WITH SCREENSHOTS:

1. **❌ ATTENTION SHOWS 7/7 INSTEAD OF 10/10**
   - TimeBlockAttentionManager.CreateFreshAttention() sets to 10
   - But UI displays 7/7
   - Something is overriding the value

2. **❌ TIME DOESN'T UPDATE WHEN TRAVELING**
   - Travel shows "15 minutes pass..." toast
   - But clock stays at 06:00 AM
   - ProcessTimeAdvancementMinutes() not working

3. **❌ RESOURCE ICONS STILL SHOW LETTERS**
   - CSS fixes were applied to remove ::before content
   - But "C", "H", "A" still appear before icons
   - Possible CSS caching or other file overriding

4. **❌ HUNGER NOT INCREASING**
   - Code added to increase +20 per period
   - But no verification it works
   - Likely tied to time system not advancing

## ❌ POC NOT READY - CRITICAL BUGS REMAIN

**Major Blockers Preventing POC**:

1. **❌ ATTENTION SYSTEM BROKEN**
   - Shows 7/7 instead of 10/10
   - Can't do proper conversations with wrong attention

2. **❌ TIME SYSTEM BROKEN**  
   - Travel doesn't advance time
   - Hunger won't increase without time advancing
   - Deadlines meaningless without working time

3. **❌ UI NOT MATCHING MOCKUPS**
   - Resource icons still show letters (C, H, A)
   - Container width not constrained
   - Missing medieval styling

**POC Test Flow Status**:
1. Start at Market Square Fountain (✅ Works)
2. Move to Merchant Row (✅ Works)
3. Quick Exchange with Marcus (❓ Not tested)
4. Return to Fountain (✅ Works)
5. Observe "Guards blocking north road" (❓ Not tested)
6. Travel to Copper Kettle Tavern (⚠️ Travel works but time doesn't update)
7. Move to Corner Table (✅ Works)
8. Conversation with Elena in DESPERATE (❓ Can't test with broken attention)
9. Generate letter at 10 comfort (❌ Can't reach without proper attention)

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/git/wayfarer/src
dotnet clean && dotnet build --no-incremental
ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://localhost:5127" dotnet run
```

**DO NOT CLAIM POC IS READY - IT IS NOT**

## 📚 LESSONS LEARNED FROM SESSION 46

### WHAT WENT WRONG:

1. **AGENTS CLAIMED SUCCESS WITHOUT VERIFICATION**
   - Systems-architect-kai said crisis conversations were fixed
   - General-purpose agent said attention/hunger/time were fixed
   - UI-UX-designer-priya said travel button was fixed
   - ALL were wrong when tested with screenshots

2. **CODE CHANGES DON'T ALWAYS WORK**
   - Changed CreateFreshAttention() to 10 but UI shows 7
   - Added hunger increase code but time doesn't advance
   - Removed CSS ::before content but letters still appear
   - Toast shows "15 minutes pass" but clock stays at 06:00 AM

3. **MUST VERIFY WITH SCREENSHOTS**
   - Code that compiles doesn't mean it works
   - Agents saying "fixed" doesn't mean it's fixed
   - Only screenshots prove actual functionality
   - User was right: "verify using screenshots, not only code"

### TECHNICAL DEBT:

1. **ATTENTION SYSTEM**
   - Something overrides the 10 value set in TimeBlockAttentionManager
   - Need to trace where 7 comes from
   - Possibly hardcoded elsewhere

2. **TIME SYSTEM**
   - ProcessTimeAdvancementMinutes() not updating UI
   - Toast messages work but actual time doesn't change
   - Time block transitions not triggering hunger increase

3. **CSS ISSUES**
   - Letters (C, H, A) still appear despite removing ::before
   - Possibly another CSS file overriding
   - Or browser cache issue

### NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES:

1. **FIX WITH VERIFICATION**
   - Make change → Rebuild → Test with Playwright → Screenshot
   - Don't trust code changes without visual proof
   - Don't mark tasks complete without screenshot verification

2. **DEBUG SYSTEMATICALLY**
   - Add console logging to trace values
   - Find where attention 7 comes from
   - Find why time doesn't update in UI
   - Find which CSS file adds the letters

3. **BE HONEST ABOUT STATUS**
   - Current state: 20-30% functional
   - Major systems broken
   - POC not playable
   - Need fundamental fixes before claiming progress
