## Remaining Tasks (0 critical, 3 enhancements)

### ✅ FIXED: Movement tutorial flags

- Need check in TimeManager.AdvanceTime() for 0 stamina
- Force rest action when stamina depleted
- Implement "robbed while unconscious" consequence
- Add narrative message for collapse event

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **Movement System**: Travel is handled through TravelManager, not LocationAction
2. **Flag-Based Progress**: Tutorial uses flags for progression, not day numbers
3. **No Special Rules**: Following game design principle - leverage system handles priority
4. **UI Visibility**: Should be based on player achievements, not arbitrary days

- `/src/GameState/NarrativeBuilder.cs` - Tutorial narrative definition
- `/src/GameState/TravelManager.cs` - Added tutorial flag tracking
