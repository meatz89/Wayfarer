- Draw pile empties around turn 5-6
- Exhaust shuffle creates known information
- Can plan for specific cards returning

## Design Notes

This deck creates cascading pressure through:
1. **Inherent +3 doubt** forcing immediate decisions
2. **5 Impulse cards** creating draw penalties
3. **Momentum consumers** forcing progress sacrifice
4. **Scaling effects** rewarding different game states
5. **Emergency options** with severe costs

The result is 5-10 turns of impossible choices where every path has clear downsides, matching the elegant brutality of Slay the Spire's opening turns while maintaining narrative verisimilitude.
