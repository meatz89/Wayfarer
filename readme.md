# Wayfarer: Complete Design Document

## Core Design Philosophy

Wayfarer is a medieval life simulation that achieves mechanical depth through literary presentation. Every system serves the central tension: limited attention, limited time, mounting obligations. The game uses AI-driven narrative generation to create unique stories from deterministic mechanical states, ensuring both strategic consistency and narrative variety.

### Fundamental Principles
- **Literary Over Gamey**: Mechanics are presented through narrative context, not UI elements
- **Binary Availability**: Actions are either available or not - no variable costs based on state
- **Unified Resources, Separated Context**: All actions draw from the same attention pool but maintain cognitive separation
- **Mechanics Provide Context, AI Provides Narrative**: The game generates mechanical choices; AI interprets them into human stories
- **Verisimilitude**: Every system must feel natural and appropriate to the medieval setting
- **Deep Systemic Interconnection**: Every mechanical element influences every other element
- **Elegant Simplicity**: Simple rules that create complex emotional states through context, not calculation
- **Intentional Design**: Every mechanic serves a specific purpose - no friction without meaning

## The Master Key: How Letters Drive Everything

Every letter tells you everything about the current game state. When Elena has a Personal Safety letter with 2 hours remaining, the game knows she's desperate. When Lord Blackwood's Status letter expires, he becomes hostile. When Marcus has a Wealth letter with comfortable deadlines, he's calculating. 

This isn't scripted - it emerges from simple rules:
- **Sender + Stakes** determines emotional state
- **Emotional state** enables specific conversations  
- **Deadline** creates urgency and pressure
- **Weight** forces queue management decisions
- **Type** determines token rewards and displacement costs

The AI reads these same signals to generate perfect narrative. Elena's "trembling hands" emerge because the AI sees Personal Safety + 2 hours = DESPERATE. Lord Blackwood's cold demeanor emerges from Status letter + expired = HOSTILE. Marcus tapping his ledger emerges from Commerce debt making him DEMANDING.

Players never need formulas. They see Elena has a personal safety letter expiring soon and immediately understand she's desperate. They know moving it up 3 positions will cost 3 tokens with whoever gets displaced. They know breaking an obligation costs 5 tokens. This is game design at its most elegant: simple rules that create complex emotional states through context, not calculation.

## The Systemic Web: How Everything Connects

**CRITICAL**: All systems in Wayfarer are deeply interconnected. No system operates in isolation. Every mechanical state influences what actions are available, which in turn creates new states. This is not a collection of separate mechanics but a single interconnected web where pulling any thread affects the entire fabric.

### Example: Elena's Desperate Plea Emerges Systemically

Let's trace how Elena's conversation emerges from mechanical state:

1. **Letter Property**: Elena has a letter with "personal safety" stakes about Lord Aldwin's marriage proposal
2. **Time Pressure**: The letter has only 2 hours remaining before deadline
3. **Emotional Calculation**: Personal safety + urgent deadline = DESPERATE state
4. **Token Relationships**: Player has Trust 3 with Elena (personal bond), Commerce -1 (owes her money), Status 0 (no social connection), Shadow 2 (shares a secret)
5. **Queue State**: Lord Blackwood's letter occupies position 1
6. **Conversation Generation**: DESPERATE state + Trust 3 enables "I'll save you" option
7. **Mechanical Trade**: Accepting creates obligation (Elena's letters position 1) for +3 Trust
8. **Displacement Cost**: Moving Elena up requires burning Status tokens with Lord B
9. **Ripple Effects**: Lord B's relationship damaged, his future letters enter lower, his emotional state may shift

This entire complex social situation emerges from simple, interconnected rules. The narrative (trembling hands, marriage crisis) is generated by AI from the mechanical state, but the mechanical state itself tells a complete story.

## The Four Token Games: Multidimensional Relationships

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**: Every NPC maintains ALL FOUR token types with the player simultaneously. These aren't separate relationships - they're different dimensions of the SAME relationship. A noble female musician might have:
- **Trust 3**: The player has been romantically pursuing her, sharing personal moments
- **Commerce -1**: The player owes her money from a failed musical venture
- **Status 2**: She's invited the player to exclusive performances
- **Shadow 4**: They share a dangerous secret about a rival musician

Each token type represents a different aspect of how you've interacted with this single person over time.

### Trust → TIME (The Emotional Dimension)

Trust represents personal bonds, emotional intimacy, kept promises, and faith in your reliability. This could be romantic involvement, friendship, family bonds, or any deep personal connection.

**Mechanical Effects:**
- Trust 5: Their letters get +6 hours to deadline (complete faith in you)
- Trust 3: Can request one +3 hour extension per letter (they'll be patient)
- Trust 0: Normal deadlines apply
- Trust -3: All conversation choices cost +1 attention (emotional distance makes everything harder)
- Trust -5: Won't speak to you until debt repaired (relationship severed)

**With Elena (seamstress):** Trust represents your personal friendship, her faith that you'll help with her marriage crisis, the intimate conversations you've shared.

**With Lord Blackwood (noble):** Trust might represent personal respect despite class differences, perhaps you saved his daughter once, creating a bond beyond status.

### Commerce → COINS (The Economic Dimension)

Commerce represents professional reliability, business partnerships, trade relationships, and economic interdependence. Every NPC can have commercial dealings with you regardless of their primary role.

**Mechanical Effects on Income:**
- Commerce +5: 200% coin rewards from ALL deliveries
- Commerce +3: 150% coin rewards from ALL deliveries
- Commerce 0: Normal coin rewards
- Commerce -3: 50% coin rewards from ALL deliveries
- Commerce -5: No coin rewards from any delivery

**Mechanical Effects on Queue:**
- Commerce -3: Their letters enter at position 2 (they have leverage)
- Commerce -5: Their letters enter at position 1 (maximum leverage)

**With Elena (seamstress):** Commerce might represent her sewing work for you, debts from clothing repairs, or investment in her shop.

**With Lord Blackwood (noble):** Commerce could be loans he's given you, trade licenses he controls, or economic ventures you share.

### Status → ACCESS (The Social Dimension)

Status represents social recognition, public standing, reputation, and hierarchical position. Even commoners track status - it's about respect and recognition, not just nobility.

**Global Status Score = Sum of all Status tokens across all NPCs**

**Access Thresholds:**
- 0-4 Status: Common Quarter only
- 5-9 Status: + Merchant Quarter
- 10-14 Status: + Noble District
- 15-19 Status: + Castle Grounds
- 20+ Status: + Royal Court

**Individual Status Effects:**
- Status +3: Access to privileged conversation options and information
- Status +5: Letters from them start at position 7-8 (respecting your time)
- Status -3: Cannot receive their special letters (you're beneath them)
- Status -5: They only give you Tier 1 letters (won't trust you with importance)

**With Elena (seamstress):** Status might represent her vouching for you in the community, inviting you to guild events, or publicly acknowledging your help.

**With Lord Blackwood (noble):** Status is traditional social standing - has he recognized you publicly, invited you to court, acknowledged your worth?

### Shadow → LEVERAGE (The Information Dimension)

Shadow represents shared secrets, mutual vulnerability, hidden knowledge, and unspoken understandings. Every relationship has things better left unsaid.

**Leverage Mechanics with Individual NPCs:**
- Shadow 3+: Can refuse their letters WITHOUT token penalty
- Shadow 3+: Can displace their letters WITHOUT burning tokens  
- Shadow 3+: They MUST accept your requests (can't refuse)
- Shadow 5+: Auto-reveal all hidden properties of their letters
- Shadow 5+: Can force them to modify deadlines (+6 hours)

**When You Have Shadow Debt:**
- Shadow -3: Must accept their "quiet" letters (soft coercion)
- Shadow -5: They sabotage you - add +1 weight to all your letters

**With Elena (seamstress):** Shadow might be knowing about her secret romance, her family's hidden past, or promises made in confidence.

**With Lord Blackwood (noble):** Shadow could be knowledge of his debts, his illegitimate child, or political schemes you've discovered.

### How All Four Dimensions Interact

When you approach Elena in the tavern, the game checks ALL token relationships:

- **Trust 3** enables "Tell me the truth" (she'll share personal details)
- **Commerce -1** means she might mention the debt during conversation
- **Status 0** means no special social options
- **Shadow 2** enables hints about shared secrets

Her emotional state (DESPERATE from her letter) is modified by the DOMINANT relationship - in this case Trust, since it's highest. But all four dimensions affect available options and narrative generation.

When delivering letters, the reward type matches the letter type (Trust letter = Trust token), but your Commerce relationship with ALL NPCs affects coin rewards. Your Status total affects where you can go. Your Shadow relationships determine what you can get away with.

## The Attention Economy: The Core Resource

### Attention as Mental Bandwidth

Attention represents your mental and emotional capacity during any given time period. It's not time - it's your ability to engage meaningfully with the world. This creates the fundamental tension: you can see many opportunities (peripheral awareness) but can only deeply engage with a few (focused attention).

### Time Block Structure and Attention Allocation

**Morning (6 AM - 12 PM):** 5 attention points. Everyone is fresh, new letters are offered based on overnight state changes. Commerce-focused NPCs are most active. The day's possibilities spread before you.

**Afternoon (12 PM - 6 PM):** 5 attention points. Continued commerce activity, noble NPCs become available. The day's pressure mounts as morning letters tick down.

**Evening (6 PM - 10 PM):** 3 attention points. Fatigue sets in. Personal conversations favored, family and Trust NPCs available. Intimate moments as the public day ends.

**Night (10 PM - 12 AM):** 2 attention points. Only essential actions. Shadow dealings, secret meetings. Most NPCs unavailable. The hidden city emerges.

### Attention Costs Represent Engagement Depth

**FREE (0◆)** - No engagement required:
- "I should go" (walking away takes no mental effort)
- "I can't help right now" (refusing when there's no relationship)
- Basic observations (just looking around)

**SIMPLE (1◆)** - Basic engagement:
- "How are things?" (learning about their letter and needs)
- "I'll help with that" (accepting a letter into your queue)
- "Any news?" (casual information gathering)

**INVOLVED (2◆)** - Emotional investment:
- Creating obligations (making serious promises requires emotional commitment)
- Repairing relationships (apologizing and rebuilding trust)
- Complex negotiations (working out complicated arrangements)

**INTENSIVE (3◆)** - Crisis intervention:
- Only appears in DESPERATE situations
- Represents total emotional commitment to solving their crisis
- Always creates lasting change (obligations, major token shifts)

### Attention Can Be Refreshed With Coins

Because Commerce relationships generate more coins from all deliveries, wealthy players can buy efficiency:
- "Buy a meal" at tavern: 3 coins = +2 attention points
- "Quick drink" anywhere: 1 coin = +1 attention point
- Maximum once per time block (you can't just drink endlessly)
- Can exceed normal maximum (so 7/5 attention is possible)

This creates a strategic choice: spend coins on routes to save time, or on food to gain more actions?

### The Cognitive Focus UI Model

The interface literally maps human cognition. When talking to Elena, she occupies your focused attention (center screen), but you remain peripherally aware of your surroundings (edge elements). This isn't just UI design - it's a mechanical system where both compete for the same attention resource.

**CENTER SCREEN (Focused Attention):**
- Elena's face, her emotional state, her body language
- The words she's speaking, her trembling hands
- Your 5 conversation choices
- This is where you spend attention to engage

**PERIPHERAL ELEMENTS (Environmental Awareness):**
- Top corner: "⚡ Lord B: 2h 15m" (deadline pressure you can't ignore)
- Side panel: "Guards shifting nervously..." (environmental changes)
- Bottom: Current location context
- All clickable, but spending attention here means less for Elena

The genius is that you might notice guards getting restless (peripheral) while Elena begs for help (center), but investigating the guards costs attention you could use to help Elena. Every moment presents this tension between focus and awareness.

## The Letter System: Social Requests Not Cargo

### Letters Are Offers Through Conversation

Letters don't just "arrive" in your queue. NPCs offer them through conversation, creating authentic social moments where someone asks for your help. This transforms letters from abstract cargo into personal requests with emotional weight.

### The Two-Step Social Dance

Real people don't immediately dump their problems on you. They hint, they test the waters, they gauge your willingness to help. The game mirrors this:

**Step 1: "How are things?" (1◆)**
The NPC reveals their situation and shows you the letter they need delivered. You see everything - the stakes (Personal Safety), the deadline (2 hours), the weight (3 slots), the type (Trust). But you haven't committed yet. You're just learning about their need.

**Step 2: "I'll help with that" (1◆)**
Now you commit. The letter enters your queue at a position determined by your relationship. You immediately gain +1 token of the appropriate type (their good faith gesture). Their emotional state improves one level - even just accepting helps them feel better.

**Alternative: "I can't help right now" (FREE)**
Refusing costs tokens based on their emotional state:
- DESPERATE: -2 tokens (you're abandoning them in crisis)
- ANXIOUS: -1 token (they're disappointed but understand)
- CALCULATING/NEUTRAL: No penalty (it wasn't urgent)

### The Refusal Penalty: Relationship Depth Matters

Refusing help hurts more when relationships are deeper. The base penalty is -1 token, but multipliers apply:
- If they're DESPERATE: ×3 (crisis rejection)
- If you have 3+ tokens with them: ×2 (betraying established trust)
- If you have an active obligation: ×3 (breaking your promise)

These multiply together. Refusing Elena when she's desperate (×3) and you have Trust 3 with her (×2) costs -6 tokens, capped at -5. This reflects reality: refusing strangers is easy, refusing desperate friends is devastating.

### Queue Entry Position: Relationship Leverage

Where letters enter your queue depends on your token relationships. The base position is 6, but relationships modify this:

**Commerce Debt Creates Leverage:**
- Commerce -3 to -4: Position 2 (they have strong leverage)
- Commerce -5: Position 1 (maximum leverage, must deliver immediately)

**Status Creates Deference:**
- Status +3 to +4: Position 7 (they respect your time)
- Status +5: Position 8 (maximum deference to your schedule)

**Special Cases:**
- Active obligation specifies exact position
- DESPERATE + Trust ≥3: Can request position 3 (special pleading from a friend)

### Queue Mechanics: Simple but Profound

The queue has 8 slots and 12 weight capacity. Letters have weight 1-3 based on complexity. Only position 1 can be delivered. These simple rules create enormous tension.

Moving a letter up X positions requires burning X tokens with the displaced sender. The token type matches the displaced letter's type. If you move Elena's letter from position 4 to 1, displacing Lord Blackwood's Status letter, you burn 3 Status tokens with Lord Blackwood. Can't afford it? Can't move the letter.

### Queue Overflow: The Crisis Moment

When accepting a letter would exceed 12 weight, you face a crisis:

**Option 1: "I'll make room"** - Choose a letter to abandon. Full refusal penalties apply to that NPC. The letter is lost forever. You're literally throwing away someone's urgent need to help someone else.

**Option 2: "I can't carry more"** - Refuse the new letter with standard penalties.

If an obligation forces an overflow (their letter must enter at position 1 but you're full), you must abandon something. Both obligation breaking penalties AND refusal penalties apply. These cascade into relationship disasters.

### Letter Generation: State-Driven Not Random

Each morning at 6 AM, the game checks each NPC's current state. Letters aren't random events - they emerge from relationship states:

- Previous letter expired: 100% chance (they're angry and need resolution)
- Previous letter delivered late: 75% chance (they're worried about reliability)
- Previous letter delivered on time: 25% chance (routine new need)
- No previous interaction: 50% chance (reaching out for first time)

Letter properties match the NPC's personality and current emotional state:
- Type always matches personality (DEVOTED → Trust letters)
- Stakes match their vulnerability (Personal Safety for family, Reputation for nobles)
- Deadline reflects emotional intensity (desperate = 3-6 hours, anxious = 8-12 hours)
- Weight reflects complexity (safety = 3, reputation/wealth = 2, secrets = 1)

## The NPC System: Complex Living Relationships

### Every NPC Has Four Relationship Dimensions

Each NPC isn't just a single relationship type - they're a complete person with whom you can develop Trust (personal bonds), Commerce (economic ties), Status (social standing), and Shadow (shared secrets) simultaneously. These create rich, multifaceted relationships.

**Example - Lady Catherine (Noble Musician):**
- Trust 4: You've been courting her, sharing intimate concerts
- Commerce 2: You've invested in her musical troupe
- Status 3: She's introduced you to noble circles
- Shadow 1: You know about her commoner lover

All four dimensions exist simultaneously. Her personality (PROUD) determines she offers Status letters, but your relationships span all dimensions. When talking to her:
- High Trust enables personal conversations about romance
- Commerce relationship affects payment for her performances
- Status relationship determines if she'll vouch for you at court
- Shadow knowledge could be leverage or a bond

### Personality Types: Letter Generation Patterns

Each NPC's personality is rolled at character creation and never changes. This determines what TYPE of letters they generate, but remember - you maintain all four token types with them regardless.

**PROUD (Nobles, Officials):** Always generate Status letters. Never ask for help directly - they command or suggest. Their special conversation is "Your position deserves respect." Available morning and afternoon only. Their letters involve reputation, social standing, court politics.

**MERCANTILE (Merchants, Traders):** Always generate Commerce letters. Everything is negotiable to them. Their special conversation is "Let's make a deal." Available morning through evening. Their letters involve trade deals, debts, economic opportunities.

**DEVOTED (Family, Clergy, Loyalists):** Always generate Trust letters. Obligations are sacred to them. Their special conversation is "I swear to help." Available morning and evening. Their letters involve personal crises, family matters, emotional bonds.

**CUNNING (Spies, Criminals, Information Brokers):** Always generate Shadow letters. Information has a price. Their special conversation is "I know something useful." Available evening and night only. Their letters involve secrets, blackmail, underground dealings.

**STEADFAST (Workers, Guards, Common Folk):** Generate mixed letter types based on current needs. Predictable and reliable. Their special conversation is "Let me help with that." Available all day except night. Their letters vary based on situation.

### Emotional States: Modified by Dominant Token Relationship

Emotional states change instantly based on clear triggers, but the dominant token relationship (highest absolute value) modifies how the state manifests:

**Letter-Based States:**
- Has letter with <6 hours remaining: DESPERATE
- Has letter with 6-12 hours remaining: ANXIOUS  
- Has letter with >12 hours remaining: CALCULATING
- Letter expired: HOSTILE

**But modified by dominant relationship:**
- Trust dominant + DESPERATE = Pleading, personal appeals
- Commerce dominant + DESPERATE = Offering deals, leveraging debts
- Status dominant + DESPERATE = Invoking social obligations
- Shadow dominant + DESPERATE = Threatening revelation, using leverage

**When no letter exists:**
- Highest positive token ≥3: FRIENDLY (warm in that dimension)
- Highest negative token ≤-3: COLD (distant in that dimension)
- Shadow ≤-3 specifically: THREATENING (they have leverage)
- Otherwise: NEUTRAL

### How NPCs Offer Letters

Each NPC has persistent needs that regenerate based on their personality. When you select "How are things?" in conversation, they offer their letter if no letter from them exists anywhere. The letter type matches their personality, but the conversation options available depend on ALL token relationships.

## The Conversation System: Multidimensional Choices

### The Universal Five-Slot Structure

Every conversation presents exactly 5 options, but these options come from different token relationships and emotional states:

**Slot 1: EXIT** - Always "I should go" (FREE)

**Slot 2: LETTER ACTION** - Priority order:
1. "I'll help with that" (if letter revealed)
2. "How are things?" (if letter available)
3. Empty if no letter

**Slot 3: EMOTIONAL** - Based on current state and dominant token:
- DESPERATE + Trust: "I believe in you" (emotional support)
- DESPERATE + Commerce: "What's it worth to you?" (negotiate)
- DESPERATE + Status: "Your reputation depends on this" (social pressure)
- DESPERATE + Shadow: "We both know what happens if..." (implicit threat)

**Slot 4: RELATIONSHIP** - Highest threshold from ANY token type:
- Trust ≥3: "Tell me the truth" (personal revelation)
- Commerce ≥3: "Let's make a deal" (business arrangement)
- Status ≥3: "I need your endorsement" (social backing)
- Shadow ≥3: "We both know..." (leverage play)

**Slot 5: CRISIS** - Only if DESPERATE, uses dominant token type:
- Trust dominant: "I'll save you" (+3 Trust, personal obligation)
- Commerce dominant: "I'll buy your solution" (+3 Commerce, commercial obligation)
- Status dominant: "I'll stake my reputation" (+3 Status, social obligation)
- Shadow dominant: "I'll keep this quiet" (+3 Shadow, secret obligation)

### Standing Obligations: Shaped by Token Type

Obligations take different forms based on which token type you're building:

**Trust Obligations:** "I promise to deliver this personally" - Their letters position 1, break = -5 Trust
**Commerce Obligations:** "I'll prioritize your business" - Their letters position 2, break = -5 Commerce  
**Status Obligations:** "I'll maintain your reputation" - Must deliver on time, break = -5 Status
**Shadow Obligations:** "This stays between us" - Cannot reveal information, break = -5 Shadow

Each NPC can have ONE active obligation. The type depends on which token relationship created it.

## The Coin Economy: Buying Efficiency

### What Coins Actually Buy

Coins don't buy items or equipment. They buy efficiency by bypassing the game's core constraints: time and attention.

**Attention Refresh** (once per time block):
- Buy a meal at a tavern: 3 coins = +2 attention points
- Quick drink anywhere: 1 coin = +1 attention point

**NPC Schedule Extension:**
- "Could you stay longer?": 5 coins = 1 hour extension
- Only works with Commerce ≥3 OR Mercantile NPCs

**Premium Routes:**
- Walking: FREE but 30 minutes
- Cart: 2 coins for 15 minutes
- Carriage: 5 coins for 10 minutes

**Queue Services** (requires Commerce ≥3):
- Priority handling: 10 coins = jump to position 3
- Express service: 15 coins = +6 hours to deadline

### How Commerce Tokens Create Coin Income

Commerce tokens with ANY NPC affect coin rewards from ALL deliveries because merchant reputation spreads through the network. This is a global modifier:

Base rewards: 2 coins (Tier 1), 5 coins (Tier 2), 10 coins (Tier 3)

Your total Commerce modifier (average across all NPCs):
- Average Commerce -5: No coins from any delivery
- Average Commerce -3: 50% of normal coins
- Average Commerce 0: Normal coin rewards
- Average Commerce +3: 150% of normal coins
- Average Commerce +5: 200% of normal coins

## Routes and Locations: The Physical World

### Location Access Through Status

Status creates a global score that gates the physical world. This represents your total social standing across the entire community:

**Total Status = Sum of all Status tokens across all NPCs**

- 0-4 Status: Common Quarter only
- 5-9 Status: + Merchant Quarter  
- 10-14 Status: + Noble District
- 15-19 Status: + Castle Grounds
- 20+ Status: + Royal Court

You need recognition from MULTIPLE NPCs to progress. One noble's endorsement isn't enough - you need broad social acknowledgment.

### Route Types and Travel

**WALKING:** Always available, 30 minutes anywhere, FREE

**RESTRICTED:** Requires permit letter sacrifice, 15 minutes to specific destinations

**PREMIUM:** 5 coins, 10 minutes, comfortable, scheduled

During travel, you have attention for encounters based on the same time block pools.

### Special Letters in Inventory

Special letters compete with delivery letters for satchel space (10 slots total):
- **Travel Permits:** Sacrifice for permanent route unlocks
- **Introduction Letters:** Unlock new NPC relationships
- **Information Letters:** Reveal hidden knowledge
- **Payment Letters:** Pure coin value, no tokens

## Time System: Intentional Duration

### Only Real Duration Costs Time

**NO TIME COST:**
- Accepting/refusing letters (instant decision)
- Exiting conversations (walking away)
- Token exchanges (quick words)

**COSTS TIME:**
- Travel: 30/15/10 minutes based on route
- Investigation: 20 minutes (actual searching)
- Creating obligations: 15 minutes (serious negotiation)

### NPC Schedule Transitions

NPCs transition on the hour with 15-minute grace periods where they're "preparing to leave." Commerce relationships can extend schedules with coins.

## Initial Game State: The Perfect Storm (PoC)

The opening state immediately demonstrates every core system without tutorials:

**Queue:**
- Position 1: Lord Blackwood's Status letter (6 hours remaining, weight 2)
- Positions 2-8: Empty

**Available to Offer:**
- Elena: Personal Safety letter (2 hours, weight 3) - DESPERATE
- Marcus: Wealth letter (18 hours, weight 2) - CALCULATING
- Captain: No letter - NEUTRAL

**Starting Token Relationships:**

With Elena (DEVOTED personality):
- Trust 3 (personal friendship from past kindness)
- Commerce -1 (you owe her for clothing repair)  
- Status 0 (no social connection)
- Shadow 2 (you know about her arranged marriage)

With Lord Blackwood (PROUD personality):
- Trust 0 (no personal connection)
- Commerce 0 (no business dealings)
- Status -1 (slightly dismissive of your station)
- Shadow 0 (no secrets)

With Marcus (MERCANTILE personality):
- Trust 0 (purely professional)
- Commerce 1 (basic trade relationship)
- Status 0 (no social element)
- Shadow 0 (no hidden dealings)

**The Immediate Dilemma:** Elena desperately needs position 1 for her marriage crisis letter, but Lord Blackwood's letter blocks it. Your Trust 3 with Elena enables special pleading options. Your Commerce -1 with her might come up in conversation. Your Shadow 2 knowledge about her marriage gives context. Moving her letter up requires burning Status tokens with Lord Blackwood (which you lack due to Status -1).

## AI Narrative Generation: Multidimensional State to Story

### What the AI Receives

The AI gets complete relationship state across all dimensions:

- NPC: Elena
- Personality: DEVOTED
- Current State: DESPERATE (Personal Safety letter, 2 hours)
- Token Relationships:
  - Trust 3 (personal bond)
  - Commerce -1 (player owes money)
  - Status 0 (no social connection)
  - Shadow 2 (shared secret about marriage)
- Dominant Relationship: Trust (highest absolute value)
- Letter Details: Position 4, about marriage refusal
- Location: Tavern, Crowded, Evening

### What the AI Generates

The AI weaves all relationship dimensions into the narrative:

*"Elena's fingers worry her shawl as she leans forward, voice barely above a whisper despite the tavern's noise. 'The letter contains Lord Aldwin's marriage proposal. My refusal.' Her eyes meet yours with the trust built over many kindnesses. 'I know you still owe me for the coat repair,' she adds with a weak smile, 'but that doesn't matter now.' She glances nervously at the door. 'You're the only one who knows the truth about why I can't marry him.' Her hand trembles as she pushes the letter across the table."*

The AI incorporates:
- Trust 3: "trust built over many kindnesses"
- Commerce -1: "still owe me for the coat repair"
- Shadow 2: "the only one who knows the truth"
- DESPERATE state: "trembles", "voice barely above a whisper"

## The Complete Systemic Loop

Every action ripples through all four relationship dimensions:

1. **Morning Assessment**: Each NPC's state and all token relationships determine offerings
2. **Social Encounters**: All four token types affect available conversation options
3. **Letter Acceptance**: Position affected by Commerce debt or Status deference
4. **Queue Management**: Burns tokens based on displaced letter types
5. **Delivery Success**: Rewards match letter type but affect specific dimension
6. **Token Changes**: Modify emotional states and future interactions
7. **Commerce Network**: Affects ALL coin income regardless of source
8. **Status Accumulation**: Total across ALL NPCs determines access
9. **Shadow Leverage**: Enables rule-breaking with specific individuals
10. **Trust Extensions**: Provide deadline flexibility per relationship
11. **Multidimensional Ripples**: One action affects multiple token types

## Critical Design Insights

### What Makes It Work

1. **Every NPC has four relationship dimensions** - Rich, complex relationships
2. **Letter type determines rewards** but all tokens affect different systems
3. **Commerce affects global income** from all sources
4. **Status is a community-wide score** requiring broad recognition
5. **Shadow enables targeted manipulation** of specific relationships
6. **Trust provides personal flexibility** based on individual bonds
7. **Personality determines letter type** but not relationship possibilities
8. **Dominant token colors emotional state** creating nuanced responses
9. **All dimensions available in conversation** based on thresholds
10. **Every action ripples through multiple dimensions** simultaneously

### What to Avoid

1. **Never limit NPCs to single token types** - Every relationship is multidimensional
2. **Never make tokens interchangeable** - Each serves distinct purpose
3. **Never calculate averages during play** - Use dominant for state, total for Status
4. **Never hide relationship complexity** - Show all four dimensions in UI
5. **Never make personality restrict relationships** - Only affects letter generation

### The Perfect Moment

When approaching Elena in the tavern, the player sees a complete person:
- The Trust they've built through past kindness enables special help
- The Commerce debt adds subtle tension to the conversation
- The lack of Status means no social leverage
- The Shadow knowledge about her marriage adds context
- Her DEVOTED personality means she'll generate Trust letters
- Her DESPERATE state (from the letter) creates crisis options
- All four relationships will be affected by how you respond

## Conclusion

Wayfarer achieves systemic elegance through multidimensional relationships. Every NPC is a complete person with whom you maintain Trust (personal), Commerce (economic), Status (social), and Shadow (information) relationships simultaneously. These four dimensions create different strategic paths while remaining interconnected - Commerce affects global income, Status provides global access, Shadow enables targeted leverage, and Trust offers personal flexibility.

The genius is that a single conversation with Elena involves all four dimensions at once. Her personality determines what letters she offers, but your complete relationship history determines how the conversation unfolds. The AI reads all four token states plus the mechanical situation to generate rich narrative that reflects the full complexity of human relationships.

Players don't manage abstract tokens - they navigate real relationships where personal trust coexists with economic debt, where social standing doesn't erase shared secrets, where every dimension of human connection matters. The same person who trusts you might resent what you owe them. The same noble who respects your status might fear what you know.

This creates infinite emergent stories from simple rules, all stemming from the fundamental understanding that every relationship is multidimensional, every letter cascades through the system, and every choice echoes through all four dimensions of human connection.
