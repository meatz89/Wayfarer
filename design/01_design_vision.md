# Design Section 1: Design Vision and Player Experience Goals

## Purpose

This document defines the core vision and player experience goals for Wayfarer. It articulates what kind of game Wayfarer is, what emotional experiences it creates, what it explicitly avoids, and how we measure whether the design is succeeding. This vision guides all design decisions and serves as the North Star for development.

---

## 1.1 Core Experience Statement

**Wayfarer creates strategic depth through impossible choices, not mechanical complexity.**

Every decision forces the player to choose between multiple suboptimal paths, revealing character through constraint. The game is not about winning - it's about deciding what you're willing to sacrifice to achieve what matters most to you.

### The Essential Experience

You are a traveler in a low-fantasy world managing scarce resources across an unforgiving landscape. You accept delivery jobs to earn coins, navigate dangerous routes where every encounter demands difficult choices, and return barely able to afford food and shelter. Profit margins are razor-thin. Every coin spent on safety is a coin not spent on advancement. Every moment spent developing relationships is time not spent earning income.

The core feeling: **"I can afford to do A OR B, but not both. Both paths are valid. Both have genuine costs. Which cost will I accept?"**

This is not a puzzle with a correct answer. It's life management through continuous triage. You cannot save everyone. You cannot maximize everything. Your character emerges not from what you achieve, but from what you sacrifice along the way.

---

## 1.2 Player Fantasy

### You Are: A Low-Fantasy Traveler

**Not a hero.** Not chosen. Not destined. You are a working traveler navigating a harsh world through resourcefulness, relationships, and careful planning.

**You survive through:**
- **Optimization skill** - Learning routes, managing resources efficiently, spotting opportunities
- **Social intelligence** - Building relationships that provide advantages, navigating complex social dynamics
- **Strategic planning** - Deciding what to pursue, what to sacrifice, when to take risks
- **Tactical execution** - Succeeding in challenges through card play mastery when necessary

### The World: Grounded Historical-Fantasy

**Low-magic setting** where danger comes from terrain, weather, bandits, politics, and human nature. Magic exists but is rare, mysterious, and never your primary tool.

**Verisimilitude throughout:** All systems mirror real-world dynamics. Relationships deplete when used. Extreme positions have consequences. Helping one faction angers another. Resources are genuinely scarce. The world doesn't care about your success.

**Geography matters:** Hex-based travel through varied terrain. Routes have personality through fixed environmental challenges. Venues cluster related locations. Distance creates strategic decisions.

### The Journey: Infinite and Personal

**No ending.** The road goes on forever. Success is not reaching a destination - it's the person you become along the way, the relationships you forge, the places you discover, and the moments you remember.

**Your story emerges through:**
- **Resource priorities** - What you choose to invest in reveals values
- **Relationship patterns** - Who you help, who you disappoint, why
- **Build specialization** - Skills you develop, weaknesses you accept
- **Narrative choices** - Moments where you reveal character through constraint

---

## 1.3 Emotional Aesthetic Goals

### Primary: Contemplation Through Constraint

The game creates space for meaningful contemplation. Choices are not timed. You can pause, consider consequences, calculate costs, weigh priorities. The pressure comes from scarcity, not from artificial urgency.

**Questions you ask yourself:**
- "Can I afford this cost right now?"
- "Which resource matters more to me - time or coins?"
- "Is building this relationship worth delaying equipment upgrades?"
- "Do I pursue the difficult optimal path or accept the suboptimal safe path?"

### Secondary: Meaningful Consequence

Every choice has weight. Resources spent are genuinely spent. Relationships invested in create obligations. Specializations create vulnerabilities. You live with your decisions.

**Not regret, but acceptance.** The game teaches letting go of perfectionism. You cannot have everything. Some paths close permanently. Some people will be disappointed. This is not failure - this is life.

### Tertiary: Journey Over Destination

**Frieren Principle:** The game is never-ending. The main story thread is infinite. There is no "beating the game" or "completing the content." Success is measured by the quality of your journey, not arrival at a finish line.

**Why this matters:** Removes pressure to rush. Encourages exploration over optimization. Creates permission to engage with content at your own pace. The A-story waits - pursue side content for hours, then return when ready.

### Avoided Emotions

**No power fantasy.** You never become unstoppable. Resources remain scarce. Challenges remain challenging. Growth is incremental, not exponential.

**No artificial urgency.** No ticking clocks forcing rushed decisions. Time pressure comes from opportunity cost (spending time here means not spending it elsewhere), never from arbitrary deadlines.

**No guilt manipulation.** The game never punishes you for not engaging with content. NPCs don't die because you ignored them. Routes don't close because you didn't take them. The world persists, patient.

---

## 1.4 Anti-Goals: What Wayfarer Is NOT

### Not a Power Fantasy

**No exponential growth.** Stats improve slowly through deliberate investment. Equipment provides incremental advantages, not transformative power. Late-game challenges remain genuinely challenging.

**No "becoming unstoppable."** Resource scarcity persists throughout. You never reach a state where costs don't matter. Optimization provides efficiency, not immunity.

**No hero's journey arc.** You don't save the world. You don't defeat the dark lord. You travel, work, survive, build relationships, and continue traveling. The journey is the point.

### Not Combat-Focused

**Challenges are not primarily violent.** Social challenges (conversation, negotiation, influence) are as common as physical challenges. Mental challenges (investigation, deduction, analysis) are equally important.

**Violence is a tool, not the solution.** When physical challenges occur, they're about navigating obstacles (climbing cliffs, crossing rivers, managing terrain), not defeating enemies in combat.

**Success through many paths.** Every situation offers multiple approaches. High combat stats open some options, but social stats, mental stats, or resource expenditure open others. No single build is required.

### Not Story-Gated

**Gameplay comes first, story second.** Narrative content provides context and flavor, but mechanical systems create strategic depth. Visual novel scenes are delivery vehicles for choice-driven resource management gameplay.

**No "gate content behind story completion."** The A-story is infinite and optional. Pursuing it provides structure and progression, but side content is always accessible. You choose when to engage with main narrative threads.

**No forced story moments.** The game never stops gameplay to deliver exposition. Scenes appear at locations as opportunities. You engage when ready, not when the game demands.

### Not Boolean-Gated Progression

**No "unlock next tier" design.** Content isn't hidden behind completion flags. Instead, completing content **creates new content** that didn't exist before. Rewards spawn new scenes rather than revealing hidden ones.

**No arbitrary prerequisites.** Requirements are resource arithmetic: "Can I afford this cost?" not "Have I completed the prerequisite checklist?"

**No linear railroad.** Multiple parallel progression threads exist simultaneously. Choose which to pursue based on resources, interests, and priorities.

### Not Completionist-Friendly

**You cannot do everything.** Resources are too scarce. Time is limited. Specialization forces vulnerability. Some endings are mutually exclusive. Some relationships will fail.

**Acceptance of loss is required.** The game teaches letting go. You cannot save everyone. Some content will remain unexperienced. Your playthrough is defined by what you chose, not what you completed.

**No "perfect run" possible.** Guides can optimize specific paths, but no path achieves everything. Trade-offs are mandatory, not optional.

## 1.5 Success Metrics: How We Know Design Is Working

### Player Decision Quality

**Good sign:** Players spend time deliberating between options, weighing costs against current resources and future plans.

**Bad sign:** Players immediately select "best" option, or all options feel equivalent.

**Test:** Are players saying "I want to do both but can only afford one"? If yes, impossible choices are working.

### Resource Pressure Feeling

**Good sign:** Players express tension about resource management. "I need to be more careful with coins." "I'm running low on time segments." "I can't afford to get injured right now."

**Bad sign:** Players accumulate surplus resources. "I have so much money I don't know what to spend it on." Resources feel abundant rather than scarce.

**Test:** Do players regularly face situations where they can't afford desired options? If yes, scarcity is working.

### Specialization Identity

**Good sign:** Players describe their character build with personality. "I'm an investigator specialist." "I'm playing a social diplomat." "I'm focusing on economic efficiency over stat development."

**Bad sign:** All players converge on same build. Players can maximize everything. No sense of unique identity.

**Test:** Do different players make different build choices and experience content differently as a result? If yes, specialization is working.

### Replayability Through Variety

**Good sign:** Players express interest in trying different approaches. "Next playthrough I want to focus on relationships instead of investigations." "I wonder how a high Authority build would play."

**Bad sign:** "I saw everything in one playthrough." "There's no reason to play again - it would be the same."

**Test:** Do different builds experience different content naturally? If yes, variety is working.

### Perfect Information Clarity

**Good sign:** Players make informed decisions. "I calculated I need 12 more coins to afford the equipment upgrade, so I'll take two more deliveries."

**Bad sign:** Players express confusion. "I didn't know that would happen." "I can't tell what this costs." Mystery gates frustrating players.

**Test:** Can players accurately predict consequences before committing? If yes, perfect information is working.

### Emotional Weight of Sacrifice

**Good sign:** Players express attachment to sacrificed options. "I really wanted to help that NPC but couldn't afford the time." "I regret neglecting investigation skills."

**Bad sign:** Players feel nothing about choices. "Doesn't matter which I pick." Sacrifices don't register emotionally.

**Test:** Do players remember specific difficult choices hours later? If yes, meaningful consequence is working.

### Playability Accessibility

**Good sign:** All content is reachable from game start through clear action paths. No broken links. No orphaned content. No soft-locks.

**Bad sign:** Players get stuck. "I can't progress." "I don't know what to do." Content exists but is inaccessible.

**Test:** Can we trace complete action path from game start to any piece of content? If yes, playability is working.

## 1.6 The Frieren Principle: Infinite Journey Design

### Why Infinite?

**Narrative Coherence:** You travel. You arrive places. You meet people. Each place leads to another. Each person you meet suggests somewhere else worth visiting. The journey itself IS the point, not reaching anywhere specific.

**Mechanical Elegance:** Infinite A-story eliminates the hardest problems of traditional narrative design:
- No arbitrary ending point to justify
- No narrative closure pressure
- No post-ending gameplay awkwardness
- Infinite replayability built-in
- Perfect for live game evolution

**Player Agency:** Player chooses WHEN to pursue A-story, not IF. A-story waits. No time pressure, no failure state, no forced progression. Pursue immediately or explore side content for hours first. The main thread persists.

### How It Works

**Procedurally-generated A-story spine:** The main narrative thread is generated dynamically, providing structure and progression without resolution. Each phase leads naturally to the next. New regions become accessible. New NPCs appear. The story continues as long as you play.

**Parallel B-stories:** Hand-crafted side content exists alongside procedural A-story. NPCs have personal storylines. Locations have mysteries. These provide grounded narrative experiences while A-story provides infinite structure.

**No pressure to engage:** The A-story doesn't force itself on you. It appears as opportunities at specific locations. You can ignore it for dozens of hours, pursuing only side content. When you choose to engage, it's waiting.

### Philosophical Foundation

**Frieren: Beyond Journey's End** demonstrates the power of journey-focused narrative. The destination mattered less than the experiences along the way, the people met, the moments shared.

Wayfarer embraces this fully. There is no ending to rush toward. There is no "beating the game." Success is not measured by completion percentage. Success is measured by the quality of your journey - the stories you create, the relationships you forge, the person you become.

---

## 1.7 Perfect Information Philosophy

### The Principle

**Before making any meaningful choice, players see exactly what it will cost and what they'll gain.**

No hidden consequences. No mystery gates. No "you couldn't have known that would happen." Players make strategic decisions with complete transparency.

### Strategic Layer Transparency

**All visible before commitment:**
- Exact resource costs (coins, time segments, energy, hunger)
- Stat requirements for gated options (shows "Requires Insight 3, you have 2")
- Rewards upon completion (what you'll gain)
- Known risks (environmental dangers, challenge difficulty)

**UI presentation:**
- Choice cards display costs prominently
- Requirements shown on locked options with exact gaps
- Current resource levels always visible
- No information hidden "for surprise"

### Tactical Layer Opacity

**Strategic transparency, tactical mystery:**
- Player sees challenge exists and difficulty level (strategic)
- Player doesn't see exact card draws or challenge flow (tactical)
- Decision is "Should I attempt this challenge?" (informed)
- Execution is "How do I play my cards optimally?" (skill)

**Why this split:**
- Strategic layer: Deciding WHAT to do requires perfect information
- Tactical layer: Executing HOW provides engaging uncertainty
- Players can assess risk before committing
- But execution still requires adaptation and skill

### Design Rationale

**Respects player intelligence:** Players are smart. Give them information, they make interesting decisions. Hide information, they feel manipulated.

**Enables planning:** Players can calculate multi-step strategies. "If I take this delivery (30 coins) minus food (10) and lodging (15), I'll net 5 coins. Need 60 for equipment, so 12 successful deliveries."

**Creates trust:** Game doesn't trick players. No "gotcha" moments. Consequences flow naturally from choices, not from hidden mechanics.

**Supports optimization:** Mastery comes from using perfect information effectively, not from memorizing hidden mechanics through trial-and-error.

## 1.8 Playability Over Compilation Mandate

### The Prime Directive

**A game that compiles but is unplayable is WORSE than a game that crashes.**

Code that runs but blocks progress is more dangerous than code that fails obviously. Inaccessible content is worthless - worse than non-existent, because it creates false expectations.

### The Playability Test

Before ANY content is marked complete, answer with 9/10 certainty:

**1. Can the player REACH this content from game start?**
- Trace EXACT player action path from spawn to content
- Verify ALL links (routes, scenes, NPCs, locations)
- No missing connections, broken references, or inaccessible islands

**2. Can the player SEE this content in UI?**
- Actions appear as clickable buttons/cards
- Scene cards render in location view
- Routes visible in travel screen
- NPCs show interaction options

**3. Can the player EXECUTE this content?**
- Actions execute without errors
- Costs deducted correctly
- Rewards applied as expected
- Navigation works (challenge to location to challenge)

**4. Does player have FORWARD PROGRESS from every state?**
- No soft-locks (trapped states)
- No dead-ends (locations with no exits)
- No orphaned content (systems with no entry points)

### Why This Matters

**In an infinite game, soft-locks are catastrophic.** Player cannot "restart" or "load earlier save" when 50+ hours deep. A single unreachable state destroys the entire experience.

**Broken links are silent failures.** Code compiles. Tests pass. But player clicks button and nothing happens, or action spawns content in wrong location, or reward creates scene at inaccessible venue. The game appears to work but progression breaks.

**Completeness is not compilation.** A feature is complete when:
- Path exists (all links present in JSON/code)
- Path is functional (all links execute correctly)
- Path is discoverable (player can find through normal play)
- No broken links (no null routes, missing scenes, inaccessible NPCs)

The number of actions is IRRELEVANT. What matters: **Path exists, path works, player can find it.**

### Enforcement

**Test in browser, verify EVERY link works.** Don't mark content complete until you've played through the entire path from game start. Inaccessible content is worthless.

**Trace action paths explicitly.** Can you draw a diagram from game spawn to this content? Every arrow must be a real, testable action. No "player will figure it out" - prove it's reachable.

**No orphaned systems.** Every gameplay system must have entry point from main game flow. If players can't naturally discover it, it doesn't exist.

## 1.9 Design Principle Tier Hierarchy

When design goals conflict, use this priority to resolve:

### TIER 1: Non-Negotiable (Never Compromise)

**No Soft-Locks**
- Always forward progress
- If design creates possibility of unwinnable state, redesign completely
- Safety nets mandatory (fallback options, zero-cost repeatable actions)

**Single Source of Truth**
- One owner per entity type
- Redundant storage creates desync bugs
- HIGHLANDER principle: There can be only one instantiation path

### TIER 2: Core Experience (Compromise Only with Clear Justification)

**Playability Over Compilation**
- Game must be testable and playable
- Unplayable code is worthless even if architecturally pure
- Broken links worse than crashes

**Perfect Information at Strategic Layer**
- Player can calculate strategic decisions
- Hidden complexity belongs in tactical layer only
- Mystery gates forbidden

**Resource Scarcity Creates Choices**
- Shared resources force trade-offs
- Boolean gates insufficient
- Impossible choices are mandatory

### TIER 3: Architectural Quality (Prefer but Negotiable)

**Elegance Through Minimal Interconnection**
- Systems connect at explicit boundaries
- Acceptable complexity for critical features
- Simplicity preferred but not required

**Verisimilitude**
- Relationships match conceptual model
- Can bend for gameplay necessity
- Fiction supports mechanics where possible
