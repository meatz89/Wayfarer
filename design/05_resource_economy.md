# Game Design Section 5: Resource Economy and Scarcity Design

## 5.1 Overview

Resource economy forms the foundation of strategic depth in Wayfarer. While challenge mechanics provide tactical execution, resource scarcity creates **impossible choices** - situations where all options are valid but insufficient resources force accepting one cost to avoid another.

This section explores how resource competition, scarcity philosophy, and arithmetic-based requirements create strategic gameplay without mechanical complexity. The economy is **intentionally tight** - delivery earnings barely cover survival costs, forcing optimization skill and meaningful trade-offs.

**Core Economic Principle**: Shared resource competition creates strategic depth. Systems that compete for the same scarce resources force players to prioritize, specialize, and accept opportunity costs.

---

## 5.2 Resource Taxonomy

Wayfarer uses three distinct resource categories with different gameplay functions.

### 5.2.1 Universal Resources (Compete Across All Systems)

Universal resources create strategic tension by forcing competition between different gameplay systems. When multiple actions want the same resource, player must prioritize.

**Time**:
- Measured in time blocks per day (typically 8-10 blocks)
- Consumed by travel, services, rest, investigation sessions
- Most constrained resource (cannot buy more time)
- Forces daily prioritization: What will you do TODAY?

**Focus**:
- Mental energy pool (typical range: 0-10)
- Consumed by Mental challenge entry and strategic planning
- Depletes from mental exertion, worry, stress
- Restored by rest (costs time blocks)
- Determines Attention available in Mental challenges

**Stamina**:
- Physical energy pool (typical range: 0-10)
- Consumed by Physical challenge entry and travel exertion
- Depletes from physical activity, carrying loads, combat
- Restored by rest (costs time blocks)
- Determines Exertion available in Physical challenges

**Health**:
- Life force pool (typical range: 0-10)
- Consumed by injury, disease, extreme exertion
- Depletes from failed Physical challenges, dangerous choices
- Restored by healing services (costs coins AND time)
- Reaching 0 Health = incapacitation (severe consequences)

**Coins**:
- Economic currency (no upper limit)
- Consumed by purchases, services, bribes, equipment
- Earned through delivery jobs, quest rewards, NPC gifts
- Restored by taking jobs (costs time)
- Universal exchange medium (converts to other resources)

**Resolve**:
- Emotional resilience pool (typical range: 0-10)
- Consumed by Social challenge entry and difficult conversations
- Depletes from stress, rejection, emotional challenges
- Restored by pleasant activities, companionship (costs time/coins)
- Determines willingness to engage social systems

### 5.2.2 Tactical Resources (System-Specific)

Tactical resources exist ONLY within challenge sessions. They do not compete across systems because they exist in separate temporal contexts.

**Builder Resources** (Progress Toward Victory):
- **Momentum** (Social challenges): Progress in conversation toward persuasion goal
- **Progress** (Mental challenges): Advancement in investigation toward solution
- **Breakthrough** (Physical challenges): Overcoming obstacle toward completion

**Session Resources** (Action Economy):
- **Initiative** (Social challenges): Generated by Foundation cards, spent on Statements
- **Attention** (Mental challenges): Derived from Focus, spent on ACT cards
- **Exertion** (Physical challenges): Derived from Stamina, spent on EXECUTE cards

**Threshold Resources** (Danger Toward Failure):
- **Doubt** (Social challenges): NPC frustration accumulating toward forced conversation end
- **Exposure** (Mental challenges): Investigation footprint increasing difficulty
- **Danger** (Physical challenges): Harm accumulating toward injury/failure

**Flow Mechanics** (System-Specific State):
- **Cadence** (Social): Conversation rhythm affecting card costs
- **Leads** (Mental): Investigative threads enabling OBSERVE draws
- **Aggression** (Physical): Caution/recklessness spectrum affecting risks

These resources matter tactically but do NOT create strategic competition. Player cannot "save Mental Attention to use in Social challenge" - they exist in separate contexts.

### 5.2.3 Persistent Resources (Permanent Character State)

Persistent resources represent permanent character progression and cannot be depleted temporarily.

**Stats** (Capability Thresholds):
- Insight, Rapport, Authority, Diplomacy, Cunning
- Range: 0-20 (typical progression: 3 → 15 over many hours)
- Gained through challenge card play and deliberate training
- NEVER decrease (permanent progression only)
- Gate strategic choices and tactical card access

**Equipment** (Owned Items):
- Investigation tools, climbing gear, fine clothing, weapons
- Purchased with coins (permanent investment)
- Provide passive tactical benefits (increased caps, reduced costs)
- No durability loss (permanent once acquired)

**NPC Relationships** (Social Capital):
- Per-NPC relationship scores (typical range: -5 to +5)
- Built through positive interactions, gifts, quest completion
- Depleted by requesting favors, disappointing NPCs, conflicts
- Different from universal resources: Per-entity, not global pool

**Understanding** (Tactical Mastery):
- Cross-system tactical progression (range: 0-20+)
- Gained through challenge victories and efficient play
- Unlocks higher card tiers across ALL challenge types
- Represents growing tactical skill, not story progression

## 5.3 Scarcity Philosophy: The Tight Economy

Wayfarer's economy is **intentionally constrained**. Resources are precious, costs are significant, and profit margins are slim. This creates strategic gameplay through meaningful resource management.

### 5.3.1 Core Economic Constraint

**Delivery earnings barely cover survival costs.**

A typical successful delivery cycle:
- Accept delivery job: Earn 30 coins
- Route requirements: 6 time blocks, various energy costs during encounters
- Return to hub: Mandatory food purchase 10 coins, lodging 15 coins
- **Net profit: 5 coins**

Equipment upgrade costs: 60 coins (requires 12 successful deliveries).

### 5.3.2 Why Tight Economy Matters

**Every Choice Has Weight**: Small profit margins mean every decision matters. Spending 5 coins on better food vs saving for equipment is meaningful choice.

**Optimization Skill Rewarded**: Efficient play provides measurable advantage. Player who minimizes unnecessary costs accumulates buffer faster.

**Investment Feels Costly**: 60 coins for equipment upgrade represents significant commitment. Player genuinely considers: "Is this worth 12 delivery cycles?"

**Failure Is Serious**: Single costly mistake can eliminate profit buffer. Failed delivery or injury requiring expensive healing creates genuine setback.

**Recovery Is Possible**: Economy is tight but not punishing. Player can take easier routes, skip optional content, rebuild buffer. Failure creates setback, not dead-end.

### 5.3.3 Time Scarcity: The Unreplenishable Resource

Time is the MOST constrained resource because **you cannot buy more**.

**Time Block Structure**:
- Each day has 8-10 time blocks (varies by season/location)
- Sleeping requires 2 blocks minimum (restores energy)
- Actions consume 1-3 blocks each
- Cannot extend day beyond available blocks

**Time Pressure Examples**:
- Delivery with time limit: Must reach destination within 3 days
- NPC availability: Merchant only present during specific time blocks
- Scene expiration: Investigation grows cold after 5 days

**Strategic Implication**: Player must prioritize. Cannot pursue all interesting options in one day. Must decide: Work toward income? Build NPC relationship? Explore new location? Rest and restore energy?

### 5.3.4 Resource Restoration Costs

Restoration is NOT free. Recovering depleted resources requires spending OTHER resources, creating trade-offs.

**Focus/Stamina Restoration** (Rest):
- Costs: 2 time blocks minimum
- Restores: Full Focus and Stamina
- Opportunity cost: Time blocks could be spent on other activities

**Health Restoration** (Healing Services):
- Costs: 15-30 coins (based on injury severity) + 2 time blocks
- Restores: Partial or full Health depending on payment
- Opportunity cost: Coins unavailable for equipment/investments

**Resolve Restoration** (Pleasant Activities):
- Costs: 3-8 coins (meal, entertainment, companionship) + 1 time block
- Restores: Partial Resolve
- Opportunity cost: Both coins and time spent on emotional recovery

**Food (Hunger)** (not detailed in core resources but omnipresent):
- Costs: 5-15 coins per meal (quality varies)
- Required: At least one meal per day (or Stamina penalties)
- Opportunity cost: Daily coin drain reducing investment capacity

**The Pattern**: Restoration requires spending scarce resources. Cannot "rest freely" - it costs time. Cannot "heal freely" - it costs coins AND time. Every restoration decision is strategic trade-off.

---

## 5.4 Resource Flow Patterns

Understanding where resources come from (sources) and where they go (sinks) reveals the economic loops driving strategic play.

### 5.4.1 Resource Sources (How Resources Enter System)

**Coins**:
- Delivery job completion (primary source): 20-50 coins per delivery
- Quest rewards: 10-30 coins for completed investigations/requests
- NPC gifts: 5-15 coins from grateful relationships
- Found treasures: 5-20 coins from exploration

**Focus/Stamina/Resolve**:
- Rest: Restores to maximum (costs time)
- Minimal sources beyond rest (intentional constraint)

**Health**:
- Healing services: Partial restoration (costs coins + time)
- Natural recovery: Slow restoration when resting well-fed (1-2 points per night)

**Time**:
- New day: Resets available time blocks
- NO OTHER SOURCE (cannot buy more time)

**Stats**:
- Challenge card play: +1 XP to bound stat per card played
- Training services: +1-2 XP for significant coin/time investment
- Quest completion: Occasional stat rewards

**Understanding**:
- Challenge victories: +1 to +3 per victory based on difficulty and efficiency
- Cumulative across all challenge types

### 5.4.2 Resource Sinks (How Resources Leave System)

**Coins**:
- Food: 5-15 coins per meal (required daily)
- Lodging: 10-20 coins per night (required between deliveries)
- Healing: 15-30 coins per injury recovery
- Equipment: 50-200 coins per permanent upgrade
- Services: 10-50 coins for NPC services (information, access, favors)
- Bribes/Gifts: 5-30 coins for social lubrication

**Focus**:
- Mental challenge entry: 2-5 Focus per challenge
- Strategic planning: 1-2 Focus for complex decision tools (if implemented)
- Mental exertion: 1-3 Focus from stressful strategic choices

**Stamina**:
- Physical challenge entry: 2-5 Stamina per challenge
- Travel exertion: 1-3 Stamina per route segment (terrain dependent)
- Physical labor: 1-2 Stamina from carrying heavy loads

**Resolve**:
- Social challenge entry: 2-5 Resolve per challenge
- Difficult conversations: 1-2 Resolve from emotionally taxing situations
- Rejection: 1-3 Resolve from failed social attempts

**Health**:
- Failed Physical challenges: 2-5 Health per failure
- Dangerous choices: 1-3 Health from risky strategic decisions
- Disease/Poison: 1-2 Health per day until treated

**Time**:
- Every action consumes time blocks
- Sleep: 2 blocks
- Travel: 1-2 blocks per segment
- Services: 1-2 blocks per service
- Challenges: 1 block per session
- NO RECOVERY (only new day resets)

### 5.4.3 Resource Conversions (Trading One Resource for Another)

Many game systems convert one resource type to another, creating strategic exchange rates.

**Coins → Hunger Restoration**:
- Pay 10 coins → Restore hunger (prevents Stamina penalties)
- Exchange rate: ~10 coins = sustained Stamina capacity

**Coins → Health Restoration**:
- Pay 20 coins → Restore 5 Health
- Exchange rate: ~4 coins per Health point

**Coins → Time** (indirect):
- Pay for lodging instead of sleeping rough: 15 coins → Save 1 time block (wake earlier)
- Pay for fast travel: 10 coins → Save 2 time blocks (skip route segments)

**Time → Coins**:
- Take delivery job: Spend 6 time blocks → Earn 30 coins
- Exchange rate: ~5 coins per time block

**Time → Focus/Stamina**:
- Rest: Spend 2 time blocks → Restore full Focus and Stamina
- Exchange rate: 1 time block = ~5 Focus/Stamina points

**Stats → Challenge Access**:
- High Rapport → Access stat-gated social options (bypasses coin/challenge costs)
- Exchange rate: Permanent investment (stat XP) → Repeated savings (free access)

**Understanding What Trades Exist**: Player learns economic exchange rates through play. "Should I spend coins on healing or time on natural recovery?" depends on which resource more valuable in current situation.

---

## 5.5 Impossible Choice Design

**Impossible choice**: Two or more valid options, insufficient resources for both, must accept one cost to avoid another.

This is the CORE of Wayfarer's strategic depth. Not mechanical complexity, but **genuine trade-offs where every option costs something valuable**.

### 5.5.1 Orthogonal Resource Costs (Four-Choice Pattern)

Balanced choices require different choices costing different resource types. If two choices cost the same resource, higher-utility option dominates (false choice).

**Standard Four-Choice Pattern**:

**1. Stat-Gated Success Path**:
- Requires: Stat threshold (Rapport ≥ 5)
- Costs: Nothing (free once gated requirement met)
- Rewards: Best outcome (optimal path)
- Availability: Only if player invested in stat progression

**2. Money-Gated Success Path**:
- Requires: Coin payment (Pay 15 coins)
- Costs: Consumable currency (depleted, must be replenished)
- Rewards: Good outcome (reliable path)
- Availability: Always (if player has coins)

**3. Challenge Path**:
- Requires: Resolve (willingness to engage tactical layer)
- Costs: Time (1 block) + session resources (Focus/Stamina/Resolve entry cost)
- Rewards: Variable (success/failure outcomes differ)
- Availability: Always (if player willing to engage)

**4. Fallback Path**:
- Requires: Nothing
- Costs: Nothing immediate (but poor outcome)
- Rewards: Minimal or negative (worst outcome)
- Availability: Always (prevents soft-locks)

### 5.5.2 Why Orthogonal Costs Create Balance

**Different Resource Types**:
- Stat path: Permanent investment (XP spent earlier, can't un-spend)
- Money path: Consumable currency (depleted now, replenishable later)
- Challenge path: Time + skill + entry resources (multiple costs)
- Fallback path: Narrative outcome (forward progress guaranteed)

**No Dominant Strategy**: Player picks based on resource availability and strategic priorities, not mathematical optimization.

**Example - "Negotiate Inn Lodging"**:

**Choice 1** (Stat-gated): "Demonstrate your good reputation" (Rapport ≥ 5)
- Free if you meet threshold
- Best reward: Room + breakfast included (saves 5 coins tomorrow)

**Choice 2** (Money-gated): "Pay premium rate"
- Pay 20 coins immediately
- Good reward: Room unlocked (standard outcome)

**Choice 3** (Challenge): "Negotiate diplomatically" (Social challenge)
- Costs 2 Resolve to enter, 1 time block for challenge session
- Variable reward: Success = room at 10 coins, Failure = room at 25 coins

**Choice 4** (Fallback): "Sleep in stables"
- Free
- Poor reward: No rest quality bonus, +1 Exposure to elements (minor Health risk)

**Player Decision Process**:
- **High Rapport player**: Takes Choice 1 (free, invested in stat earlier)
- **Rich player**: Takes Choice 2 (coins plentiful, time valuable)
- **Skilled tactician**: Takes Choice 3 (confident in challenge, saves coins if successful)
- **Desperate player**: Takes Choice 4 (no resources, accepts poor outcome)

All four players face same situation. All four make different strategic choices based on resource availability. This is **balanced choice design through orthogonal costs**.

### 5.5.3 Trade-Off Calculations (Strategic Thinking)

Impossible choices force player to calculate trade-offs explicitly:

**Route Encounter - "Blocked Path"**:

**Choice 1**: Physical challenge to clear debris
- Costs: 3 Stamina (entry) + 1 time block
- Risk: Injury if failed (2-5 Health lost)
- Benefit: Direct path, saves 2 time blocks over detour

**Choice 2**: Take detour around obstacle
- Costs: 3 time blocks
- Risk: None
- Benefit: Safe, guaranteed progress

**Player Calculation**:
- "I have 7 Stamina (high). Physical challenge likely successful. If I attempt challenge and win, I save 2 time blocks NET (spend 1, save 3). If I fail, I lose 3 Stamina + 2-5 Health + still spend 1 time block, then must take detour anyway (4 time blocks total)."
- "Risk assessment: 70% victory chance (high Stamina, good equipment). Expected value: (0.7 × 2 blocks saved) + (0.3 × 3 blocks wasted) = 0.5 blocks saved expected."
- "Decision: Attempt challenge (positive expected value, can afford injury if unlucky)."

**Different Player, Same Encounter**:
- "I have 3 Stamina (low). Physical challenge likely to fail. If I attempt and lose, I waste time AND get injured. Can't afford healing costs."
- "Decision: Take detour (safe, guaranteed, preserves resources for later challenges)."

**Same encounter, same options, different strategic decisions based on resource state.** This is impossible choice working correctly.

### 5.5.4 Daily Priority Choices

Scarcity creates daily prioritization dilemmas:

**Morning Decision** (8 time blocks available):
- **Option A**: Take delivery job (6 blocks, earn 30 coins, guaranteed income)
- **Option B**: Develop NPC bond (3 blocks, earn relationship points, future mechanical advantage)
- **Option C**: Investigate mystery scene (4 blocks, advance story, uncertain reward)
- **Option D**: Rest and prepare (2 blocks, restore resources, improve readiness)

Cannot do all four. Must prioritize based on strategic goals and resource needs.

**Strategic Considerations**:
- Need coins for survival? Must take delivery (Option A)
- Need NPC favor for upcoming story gate? Develop bond (Option B)
- Want to experience story content? Investigate (Option C)
- Low on Focus/Stamina? Rest first (Option D)

**Every Day is Strategic Puzzle**: Limited time blocks force prioritization. Player cannot "do everything" - must choose based on current constraints.

### 5.5.5 Specialization Creates Vulnerability

Stat specialization enables powerful options in some areas while creating vulnerability in others.

**Investigation Specialist** (High Insight 15, High Cunning 12, Low Authority 3):

**Strengths**:
- Mental challenges trivial (high stat access to Tier 3 Insight cards)
- Investigation scenes offer free stat-gated paths (Insight ≥ 12 passes)
- Tactical advantage in one domain

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Physical challenges difficult (low Authority means no Tier 3 Physical cards)
- Social confrontations weak (low Authority means aggressive negotiations fail)
- Forced to spend coins on challenges that specialists bypass for free

**Strategic Implication**: Specialization is powerful but creates dependency. Specialist must accept coin costs or challenge risks in non-specialized domains. Generalist never dominant, never helpless.

**Player Choice**: Specialize for power spikes and accept vulnerability? Or generalize for consistency and accept never being optimal?

This creates **build identity through strategic trade-offs**.

---

## 5.6 Resource Arithmetic vs Boolean Gates

Wayfarer uses **resource arithmetic** for all progression gates, never boolean flags. This creates strategic depth through numeric comparison and perfect information.

### 5.6.1 The Boolean Gate Antipattern

**Boolean Gate Pattern** (FORBIDDEN in Wayfarer):

Binary checks for possession or completion that enable actions through true/false conditions, such as checking for rope possession to enable climbing or quest completion to unlock the next quest.

**Why This Creates Shallow Gameplay**:
- No resource cost: Unlocks are "free" once gate passed
- No opportunity cost: Actions don't compete for shared resources
- Linear progression: A → B → C railroad (no branching strategy)
- No specialization: Eventually complete all gates, max everything
- Checklist completion: Gameplay becomes "collect all flags"

This is "Cookie Clicker" design - incremental unlocks without strategic depth.

### 5.6.2 Resource Arithmetic Pattern

**Resource Arithmetic Pattern** (REQUIRED in Wayfarer):

Choices define stat requirements with numeric thresholds and remain always visible. Selectability determined through arithmetic comparison of player stat value against threshold value, enabling transparent progression gating through numerical assessment.

**Why This Creates Strategic Depth**:
- Resource cost: Stats require XP accumulation (time investment)
- Opportunity cost: Raising Rapport means NOT raising other stats (shared XP budget)
- Non-linear progression: Multiple valid paths with different thresholds
- Specialization matters: High Rapport enables options others can't access
- Strategic calculation: Player knows EXACT gap (need 2 more Rapport)

### 5.6.3 Perfect Information Through Arithmetic

**Player Sees**:

A confrontation choice displays the authority requirement of fourteen, shows the player's current authority of twelve, and explicitly states the two-point gap preventing selection.

**Strategic Value**:
- Gap is explicit: Need 2 more Authority points
- Player can plan: "I need to play 8-10 Authority cards in challenges to reach threshold"
- Investment is calculable: "Is 8 challenge sessions worth this option?"
- Alternative paths visible: "Or I could spend 15 coins for money-gated path"

**Perfect information enables strategic planning.** Boolean gates hide information ("HasKey" tells you nothing about HOW to get key or WHEN you'll get it).

### 5.6.4 Sweet Spots and Thresholds

Not all resources follow "more is better" logic. Some have **sweet spots** where optimal range exists.

**Stat Sweet Spots** (inspired by The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante research):

**Example - Authority Stat**:
- Authority 3-5: Basic competence, access to Tier 1 Authority cards
- Authority 10-12: Strong capability, access to Tier 2 cards, most Authority gates pass
- Authority 16+: Excessive authority, triggers auto-consequences (domineering reputation, conflict escalation)

**Why Sweet Spots Matter**:
- Encourages balanced development (over-specialization has costs)
- Creates strategic ceiling (can't just max everything)
- Forces trade-offs (is 16 Authority worth reputation consequences?)

**Example Implementation**:

When player authority reaches sixteen or higher, automatic reputation consequences trigger. NPCs perceive the player as domineering, social challenges begin with increased doubt making negotiations harder, representing the player's reputation preceding them.

Player must consider: "Do I want Authority 16 for powerful Physical cards, accepting that Social challenges become harder?"

---

## 5.7 Five Resource Layers (Depth of Economic System)

Wayfarer's resource economy operates on five distinct layers, each providing different strategic depth and gameplay implications.

### 5.7.1 Layer 1: Personal Stats (Capability Thresholds)

**What They Are**:
- Insight, Rapport, Authority, Diplomacy, Cunning
- Numeric range: 0-20 (typical progression 3 → 15 over many hours)
- Built through challenge card play and training services

**How They Work - Arithmetic Comparison**:

Scene presents choice:

A confrontation requiring authority of at least fourteen shows disabled status for a player with authority twelve, displaying both the requirement and current value with the exact two-point gap. Player sees perfect information enabling planning for stat investment.

Different choice in same scene:

A diplomatic negotiation requiring diplomacy of at least twelve shows enabled status for a player with diplomacy sixteen who exceeds the requirement.

**Strategic Depth**:
- NOT: "hasHighAuthority" boolean → true/false
- YES: Authority 12 vs requirement 14 → arithmetic comparison
- Player calculates EXACTLY what they can afford
- No mystery gates - perfect information

**Sweet Spots Exist**:
- Stats have optimal ranges (not just "more is better")
- Too high can trigger auto-consequences (reputation effects)
- Balanced development often superior to min-maxing
- Example: Authority 14 is comfortable, Authority 18 may cause social friction

### 5.7.2 Layer 2: Per-Person Relationships (Individual Capital)

**What They Are**:
- Separate numeric score for EACH NPC character
- Merchant: Your relationship with Merchant (independent)
- Guard Captain: Your relationship with Guard Captain (independent)
- Innkeeper: Your relationship with Innkeeper (independent)

**Numeric Range**:
- Approximately -5 to +5 (tight bipolar scale)
- Negative: Hostility, anger, betrayal
- 0: Neutral, indifferent
- Positive: Trust, affection, loyalty
- Each point is precious (small scale makes every point matter)

**Threshold Tiers**:

**Relationship +2**: Unlocks basic persuasion options
- Example: Merchant persuasion (small discount, basic favors)

**Relationship +3**: Unlocks multiple nuanced options
- Various choices leveraging relationship capital
- Trading on goodwill for specific benefits

**Relationship +4**: Unlocks special services/training
- Grants significant mechanical advantages
- Represents deep trust enabling exceptional help

**Asymmetric Costs (Relationship Triangulation)**:

Example:

Asking the guard captain to ignore a merchant complaint burns the favor relationship with the captain by two points, gains one point with the grateful merchant, but loses one reputation point for perceived corruption. The net effect damages two relationships to gain one, demonstrating asymmetric costs.

**Strategic Reality**:
- Actions affect MULTIPLE relationships simultaneously
- Helping one NPC can damage another (triangulation)
- Not 1:1 trades - asymmetric multi-way effects
- Forces choice: Which relationships matter most?

**Relationship Depletion Through Use**:

Critical pattern - asking favors COSTS the relationship:

Starting with innkeeper relationship at positive five, asking them to hide you from guards costs two relationship points, reducing to positive three. Later, when a different choice requires innkeeper relationship of at least positive four to vouch for your character, the option is disabled because the earlier favor depleted the relationship capital below the threshold.

**Strategic Implication**: Relationships are CAPITAL you can SPEND. Asking favors DEPLETES the resource. Must RATION who you ask and when. Real relationship management, not boolean "isFriend" flag.

### 5.7.3 Layer 3: Permanent Resources (Health, Stamina, Focus, Coins)

**What They Are**:
- Global numeric pools representing player state
- Health: 0-10 (life force)
- Stamina: 0-10 (physical energy)
- Focus: 0-10 (mental energy)
- Resolve: 0-10 (emotional resilience)
- Coins: 0-∞ (economic currency)

**Depletion and Restoration**:

**Stamina Example**:
- Start day: Stamina 10 (full)
- Physical challenge entry: -3 Stamina (now 7)
- Route travel: -2 Stamina (now 5)
- Evening: Stamina 5 remaining

**Restoration Options**:
- **Rest**: 2 time blocks → Restore to full (10)
- **Light Rest**: 1 time block → Restore half (now 7-8)
- **Push Through**: No rest → Tomorrow starts at 5 (cumulative fatigue)

**Strategic Calculation**:
- "I have 5 Stamina remaining. Tomorrow's delivery requires 6 Stamina. Must rest tonight (costs 2 time blocks) or tomorrow's job impossible."

**Coins as Universal Converter**:

Coins convert to many resources:
- Coins → Health (healing services, 20 coins = 5 Health)
- Coins → Time (fast travel, 10 coins = 2 time blocks saved)
- Coins → Access (bribes, 15 coins = bypass gate)
- Coins → Stats (training, 50 coins = 2 stat XP)

This makes coins strategically flexible - can substitute for other resources when needed.

### 5.7.4 Layer 4: Time as Competition (Calendar Days, Time Blocks)

**What It Is**:
- Calendar days (passage of time)
- Time blocks per day (8-10 blocks typically)
- Actions consume blocks (1-3 blocks each)
- Sleep advances day, resets blocks

**Why Time is Special**:
- CANNOT be purchased or restored (most constrained resource)
- Forces genuine prioritization (cannot do everything)
- Creates opportunity cost (time spent here ≠ time spent there)
- Imposes strategic rhythm (finite actions per day)

**Time Pressure Examples**:

**Daily Time Budget**:

Waking with eight available time blocks, planning a six-block delivery job, one-block food purchase, and two-block sleep totals nine blocks exceeding the budget. Player must choose which activity to skip or reduce: forego delivery income, accept food-skipping stamina penalties, or sleep less and start tomorrow with depleted energy.

**Scene Time Limits**:

An investigation into a missing merchant has a five-day time limit. Currently on day two, the player must decide whether to investigate immediately spending four time blocks today, prioritize a delivery for coins while letting the investigation grow colder, or risk waiting and potentially losing the opportunity to scene expiration.

**Strategic Depth**: Time scarcity forces impossible choices daily. Cannot pursue all opportunities. Must prioritize based on goals, resource needs, and scene urgency.

### 5.7.5 Layer 5: Ephemeral Context (Location, Active Scenes, NPC Availability)

**What It Is**:
- Current location (where player is physically)
- Active scenes at locations (investigation opportunities)
- NPC presence (who is available when)
- Environmental state (weather, events, time of day)

**Why Ephemeral Differs from Permanent**:
- Changes naturally through gameplay (not permanent stat)
- State-based rather than accumulated (position, not progression)
- Contextual constraints (some actions only available in specific contexts)

**Location Context**:

At Market Square, available actions include talking to the present merchant, investigating an active crime scene, traveling to the inn, and resting at the tavern. At a different location like Highway Rest Stop, available actions shift to continuing travel, resting briefly with limited services, and investigating a roadside shrine, but the merchant and crime scene are not present as they exist at different locations.

**NPC Availability**:

The merchant appears at Market Square during day time blocks three through seven and at Merchant Quarter during blocks one through four, but is absent during evening and night. The guard captain maintains constant availability at the Guard House during blocks one through eight and makes limited appearances at Market Square only during blocks four through six.

**Strategic Implication**: Player must plan around ephemeral context. Want to talk to Merchant? Must be at Market Square during blocks 3-7. Miss window, must wait until tomorrow or travel to Merchant Quarter.

**Scene Expiration**:

A missing merchant investigation spawned on day one, currently on day three, expires on day six with three days remaining. The player sees warning that the trail is growing cold with explicit time remaining.

Creates urgency without hard failure. Scene expires → Lose opportunity, story continues via different path. No soft-lock (forward progress guaranteed), but optimal outcomes time-sensitive.

## 5.8 Impossible Choice Examples (Detailed Analysis)

### 5.8.1 Example: "Route Delivery with Injured Companion"

**Narrative Context**:
You accepted delivery job (30 coins payment) requiring 6 time blocks. Midway through route, you encounter injured traveler needing help. You have 3 time blocks remaining to complete delivery on time.

**Resource State**:
- Coins: 8
- Health: 7/10
- Stamina: 5/10
- Focus: 6/10
- Time remaining today: 5 blocks
- Delivery deadline: 3 blocks

**Four Choices Presented**:

**Choice 1** (Stat-gated - Authority ≥ 8):
"Command traveler to follow you at your pace"
- Requires: Authority ≥ 8
- Free action (no resource cost)
- Outcome: Complete delivery on time + Traveler survives (Authority forced compliance)
- Best outcome (if you meet threshold)

**Choice 2** (Money-gated):
"Pay for emergency courier to handle delivery while you help traveler"
- Costs: 15 coins (your payment forfeited + 5 coins from your pocket)
- Outcome: Delivery completed (hired courier) + Traveler survives + Traveler gratitude (+2 relationship)
- Reliable but expensive

**Choice 3** (Challenge):
"Stabilize traveler quickly with field medicine" (Physical challenge)
- Costs: 2 Stamina (entry cost) + 1 time block
- Outcome: Success (Traveler stabilized quickly, continue delivery on time), Failure (Traveler dies OR you miss deadline)
- Risky, skill-dependent

**Choice 4** (Fallback):
"Abandon delivery to properly care for traveler"
- Free (no resource cost)
- Outcome: Delivery failed (lose 30 coins payment, reputation damage -1) + Traveler survives + Traveler deep gratitude (+3 relationship)
- Poor economic outcome, strong relationship outcome

**Player Decision Analysis**:

**High-Authority Player** (Authority 12):
- Takes Choice 1 (free, meets threshold)
- Reasoning: "I invested in Authority earlier. This situation rewards that investment. No resource cost, optimal outcome."

**Wealthy Player** (50 coins available):
- Takes Choice 2 (pay 15 coins)
- Reasoning: "I can afford 15 coins. Guaranteed success without risk. Relationship bonus valuable for future."

**Skilled Tactician** (Good Physical deck, high Stamina):
- Takes Choice 3 (Physical challenge)
- Reasoning: "70% victory chance with my deck. If successful, save coins AND complete delivery. Risk acceptable."

**Desperate Player** (Low coins, low Authority, injured):
- Takes Choice 4 (abandon delivery)
- Reasoning: "Can't afford 15 coins. Don't meet Authority gate. Too injured to risk Physical challenge. Accept economic loss, prioritize human life, build relationship capital for future."

**All Four Outcomes are Valid**: No objectively correct answer. Different players with different resource states make different strategic choices. All choices have costs, all have benefits, all advance story.

**This is Impossible Choice Design**: Orthogonal costs (stat/money/skill/outcome), genuine trade-offs, player values expressed through constraints.

### 5.8.2 Example: "Stat Development Specialization Choice"

**Context**: Player has accumulated 10 stat XP from recent challenges. Must decide how to allocate across five stats.

**Current Stat State**:
- Insight: 8
- Rapport: 5
- Authority: 6
- Diplomacy: 4
- Cunning: 7

**Strategic Paths Available**:

**Path A - Investigation Specialist**:
- Allocate: Insight +5, Cunning +5
- Result: Insight 13, Cunning 12 (High specialization)
- Enables: Tier 3 Insight cards, Tier 3 Cunning cards, dominance in Mental challenges
- Sacrifices: Rapport/Authority/Diplomacy remain low (vulnerability in Social/Physical)

**Path B - Social Specialist**:
- Allocate: Rapport +6, Diplomacy +4
- Result: Rapport 11, Diplomacy 8 (Strong social foundation)
- Enables: Tier 2-3 Rapport cards, Tier 2 Diplomacy cards, many social stat-gates pass
- Sacrifices: Insight/Cunning stagnate (Mental challenges remain difficult)

**Path C - Balanced Generalist**:
- Allocate: +2 to each stat
- Result: All stats 6-10 range (Moderate across board)
- Enables: Tier 2 cards in all stats, never locked out of any challenge type
- Sacrifices: Never dominant (no Tier 3 access anywhere), no "power fantasy" moments

**Path D - Hybrid (Two Stats)**:
- Allocate: Authority +7, Cunning +3
- Result: Authority 13, Cunning 10 (Strong in two areas)
- Enables: Tier 3 Authority cards (Physical AND Social confrontations), Tier 2 Cunning cards
- Sacrifices: Insight/Rapport/Diplomacy weak (specific vulnerabilities)

**Strategic Implications 20 Hours Later**:

**Path A Player** (Investigation Specialist):
- Encounters Mental challenges: Trivial victories, feels powerful
- Encounters Social negotiation with hostile NPC: Forced to spend 25 coins (no stat-gate access)
- Encounters Physical obstacle: Struggles, high risk of failure

**Path B Player** (Social Specialist):
- Encounters Social challenges: Easy victories, unlocks many conversation paths
- Encounters investigation: Slow progress, must revisit multiple times
- Encounters Physical obstacle: Must take detour or pay for alternative (can't force through)

**Path C Player** (Balanced Generalist):
- Encounters all challenge types: Consistent moderate performance
- Never feels dominant, never feels helpless
- Passes some stat-gates (moderate thresholds), fails high-threshold gates
- Must use coins or challenges for high-threshold options

**Path D Player** (Hybrid):
- Encounters Authority-based situations: Dominant (Physical confrontations, command situations)
- Encounters Cunning situations: Strong (tactical challenges, risk management)
- Encounters Rapport-based negotiations: Weak (must pay coins or face difficult challenges)

**No Objectively Correct Path**: Each player expresses different values:
- Path A: "I want to be a brilliant investigator, even if socially awkward"
- Path B: "I want to talk my way through problems, even if I can't solve mysteries easily"
- Path C: "I want flexibility and consistency, even if never spectacular"
- Path D: "I want power in specific areas, accepting vulnerability elsewhere"

**Strategic Depth Through Permanent Investment**: Stat allocation is (mostly) irreversible. Player lives with consequences for many hours. This creates build identity and strategic commitment.

## 5.9 Resource Pressure in Practice

### 5.9.1 Daily Resource Cycle

Typical player day demonstrates resource pressure:

**Morning (8 time blocks available, full energy)**:

**Decision Point 1**: What to prioritize today?
- Option: Take delivery job (6 blocks, earn 30 coins)
- Option: Build NPC relationship (3 blocks, earn +2 relationship)
- Option: Investigate mystery (4 blocks, advance scene)

Player has 8 blocks, cannot do all three. Must prioritize.

**Player chooses: Take delivery job** (need coins for equipment)

**Midday (2 blocks remaining, Stamina 6/10 after travel)**:

**Decision Point 2**: Use remaining time?
- Option: Quick NPC conversation (1 block, build relationship)
- Option: Rest early (2 blocks, restore full energy for tomorrow)
- Option: Investigate briefly (2 blocks, small progress)

Player chooses: Quick NPC conversation (opportunistic relationship building)

**Evening (1 block remaining, Stamina 5/10, Focus 4/10)**:

**Decision Point 3**: Final action?
- Option: Sleep now (2 blocks, restore energy) - OVER BUDGET (need 2, have 1)
- Option: Light rest (1 block, partial restoration)
- Option: Push through night (0 blocks, start tomorrow fatigued)

Player chooses: Light rest (1 block, compromised restoration, start tomorrow Stamina 8/10 instead of 10/10)

**Daily Summary**:
- Earned: 30 coins
- Spent: None yet
- Energy: Partially restored (not optimal, will feel consequences tomorrow)
- Progression: NPC +2 relationship, mystery not advanced

**Next Day Consequences**:
- Must spend 10 coins on food (or Stamina penalties)
- Must spend 15 coins on lodging (or sleep penalties)
- Net profit: 5 coins (30 - 10 - 15)
- Started day suboptimal energy (7/10 instead of 10/10) due to yesterday's time constraint

**Resource Pressure Manifesting**: Player constantly trading resources, making compromises, accepting suboptimal outcomes due to scarcity. No day goes perfectly. Every day requires strategic prioritization.

### 5.9.2 Weekly Resource Planning

Over multiple days, resource pressure compounds:

**Week 1 Goals**:
- Save 60 coins for equipment upgrade (requires 12 successful deliveries netting 5 coins each)
- Build Merchant relationship to +4 (requires 6-8 interactions)
- Advance investigation Scene (requires 15 Progress across multiple visits)

**Time Budget Reality**:
- Deliveries: 6 blocks each × 12 deliveries = 72 blocks (9 days minimum)
- Merchant interactions: 1-2 blocks each × 8 interactions = 12 blocks (1.5 days)
- Investigation sessions: 1 block each × 5 sessions = 5 blocks (0.6 days)
- Sleep/Rest: 2 blocks per day × 11 days = 22 blocks

**Total Required**: 111 blocks
**Total Available**: 8 blocks per day × 11 days = 88 blocks

**OVER BUDGET BY 23 BLOCKS**

Player cannot accomplish all three goals in one week. Must prioritize:
- Focus deliveries only? (Save coins, sacrifice relationship and investigation)
- Balance all three? (Moderate progress everywhere, extends timeline to 2 weeks)
- Focus investigation? (Advance story, sacrifice coin savings, delay equipment)

**Strategic Depth Through Scarcity**: Insufficient resources force genuine strategic choices. Player cannot "do everything" - must commit to priorities and accept opportunity costs.

### 5.9.3 Emergency Resource Decisions

Resource pressure creates emergent tension during unexpected events:

**Scenario**: Midway through delivery route (2 blocks to destination), player encounters dangerous situation requiring immediate response.

**Current Resources**:
- Health: 5/10 (injured from earlier encounter)
- Stamina: 3/10 (low after exertion)
- Coins: 12
- Time remaining today: 3 blocks

**Dangerous Encounter**: "Bandits Demand Toll"

**Options**:
- **Physical Challenge**: Fight bandits (costs 2 Stamina entry + risk 2-5 Health loss if failed)
- **Pay Toll**: Give 15 coins (don't have enough - only have 12)
- **Detour**: Take longer route around (+3 time blocks, miss delivery deadline)
- **Intimidate** (Authority ≥ 10): Free passage (player has Authority 7 - doesn't meet threshold)

**Player Analysis**:
- Can't fight: Only 3 Stamina, already injured (5 Health), high risk of incapacitation
- Can't pay: Only have 12 coins, toll is 15 coins
- Can't intimidate: Authority too low (7 vs 10 required)
- Must take detour: Only viable option

**Detour Consequences**:
- +3 time blocks = Total 5 blocks to complete delivery
- Only have 3 blocks remaining today
- Must sleep on route (no lodging available, sleep rough)
- Rough sleep: No energy restoration, +1 Exposure to elements (Health risk)
- Delivery completed late: Reduced payment (20 coins instead of 30 coins)

**Cascade of Consequences from Resource Constraints**:
1. Low Stamina prevented combat option
2. Low Health made combat too risky
3. Insufficient coins prevented payment option
4. Low Authority prevented intimidation option
5. Forced detour caused late delivery (reduced payment)
6. Late delivery caused rough sleeping (Health risk)
7. Rough sleeping caused next-day energy deficit

**Emergent Tension**: Resource pressure creates genuine danger and tension. Player feels consequences of earlier resource decisions. Not scripted drama, but emergent from resource state.

## 5.10 Design Principles Summary

### 5.10.1 Shared Resources Create Strategic Depth

When multiple systems compete for the same scarce resources, player must prioritize and specialize.

**Universal Resources** (Time, Focus, Stamina, Health, Coins):
- Used by ALL systems
- Force impossible choices (spend here OR there, not both)
- Create opportunity cost (every decision closes other options)

**System-Specific Resources** (Momentum, Progress, Breakthrough):
- Isolated within challenge sessions
- Provide tactical depth without strategic competition
- Separated concerns (strategic vs tactical)

### 5.10.2 Tight Economy Forces Meaningful Decisions

**Delivery earnings barely cover survival costs** creates strategic pressure.

**Small profit margins**:
- Every decision matters (5 coin waste is 5% of weekly budget)
- Optimization skill rewarded (efficient play accumulates advantage)
- Investment feels costly (60 coins = 12 successful deliveries = significant commitment)

**Resource restoration costs resources**:
- Rest costs time (opportunity cost)
- Healing costs coins + time (double cost)
- Cannot "freely" restore (every recovery is strategic trade-off)

### 5.10.3 Orthogonal Costs Create Balanced Choices

**Four-choice pattern** with different resource types:
- Stat-gated: Permanent investment (free if threshold met)
- Money-gated: Consumable currency (reliable if available)
- Challenge-gated: Time + skill + entry cost (variable outcome)
- Fallback: Free but poor outcome (guarantees forward progress)

No dominant strategy. Player picks based on resource availability and strategic priorities.

### 5.10.4 Resource Arithmetic Enables Perfect Information

**Numeric comparisons** instead of boolean gates:
- Player sees EXACT requirements (Authority ≥ 14)
- Player sees EXACT current state (Authority 12)
- Player calculates EXACT gap (need 2 more)
- Player plans strategically (how to gain 2 Authority? Worth the investment?)

**Perfect information** at strategic layer enables calculation and planning. No hidden gates, no mystery requirements, no trial-and-error.

### 5.10.5 Specialization Creates Identity AND Vulnerability

**Stat specialization** creates build identity:
- Investigation specialist: Dominant in Mental challenges, weak in Social/Physical
- Social specialist: Dominant in conversations, weak in investigations/obstacles
- Balanced generalist: Consistent everywhere, never dominant anywhere

**Strategic commitment**:
- Stat allocation mostly irreversible (permanent investment)
- Player lives with consequences for many hours
- Creates distinct playstyles and replayability

**Vulnerability is feature, not bug**:
- Specialist has areas of weakness (must spend coins or face difficult challenges)
- Forces adaptation and resource management
- Prevents "optimal build" that trivializes all content

## 5.11 Economic Balance Tuning

### 5.11.1 Key Economic Ratios

These ratios define the tight economy feel:

**Delivery Profit Margin**: 15-20%
- Earn 30 coins, spend 25 coins (food + lodging) = 5 coins profit
- Small buffer requires consistent success

**Equipment Cost Ratio**: 10-15× Daily Profit
- Equipment costs 50-60 coins
- Daily profit 5 coins
- Requires 10-12 successful deliveries to afford

**Healing Cost Ratio**: 3-6× Daily Profit
- Moderate injury healing: 15-20 coins
- Daily profit: 5 coins
- Single injury eliminates 3-4 days of profit

**Stat Training Cost Ratio**: 8-10× Daily Profit
- Stat training: 40-50 coins for 1-2 XP
- Daily profit: 5 coins
- Extremely expensive, rarely used (challenges more efficient for XP)

### 5.11.2 Resource Cap Tuning

**Health/Stamina/Focus Caps**: 10 points typical
- 0 = incapacitated/exhausted/mentally drained
- 5 = half capacity, noticeable limitations
- 10 = full capacity, optimal performance

**Why 10-point scale**:
- Granular enough for meaningful choices (2-point cost is significant)
- Simple enough for mental calculation (not overwhelming)
- Matches common tabletop RPG conventions (intuitive for players)

**Stat Caps**: 20 points maximum
- 0-5 = novice (Tier 1 cards only)
- 6-10 = competent (Tier 2 cards)
- 11-15 = expert (Tier 3 cards)
- 16-20 = master (Tier 4 cards, approaching sweet spot limits)

**Why 20-point scale**:
- Longer progression curve (takes many hours to reach)
- Clear tier boundaries (every 5 points unlocks new tier)
- Room for specialization vs generalization (specialize 3 stats to 15 vs generalize all to 10)

### 5.11.3 Time Block Balance

**Time blocks per day**: 8-10 typical (varies by season/location)

**Action costs**:
- Quick actions: 1 block (conversations, purchases, brief exploration)
- Standard actions: 2 blocks (challenge sessions, travel segments, services)
- Long actions: 3+ blocks (deliveries, extended investigations, long travel)

**Why 8-10 blocks**:
- Enough for meaningful daily activity (3-5 significant actions)
- Constrained enough to force prioritization (cannot do everything)
- Sleep requirement (2 blocks) leaves 6-8 productive blocks

**Example Daily Budget**:
- Sleep: 2 blocks (mandatory for energy restoration)
- Delivery: 6 blocks (earn coins)
- Remaining: 0-2 blocks (very limited for other activities)

Player feels time pressure: "If I take delivery, I have almost no time for anything else today."

## 5.12 Failure and Recovery

### 5.12.1 Failure is Setback, Not Dead-End

**Failed Physical Challenge**:
- Lost: 3 Stamina (entry cost) + 3 Health (injury)
- Applied: OnFailureReward (still advances story, different path)
- Recovery: Healing costs 15 coins + 2 time blocks

**Impact**: Significant resource loss, but recoverable. Player can take easier delivery, skip optional content, rebuild buffer over 2-3 days.

**Failed Delivery** (Late or Incomplete):
- Lost: 30 coins expected income
- Applied: Reputation damage (-1), reduced payment (10 coins instead of 30)
- Recovery: Take 2-3 successful deliveries to restore financial position

**Impact**: Economic setback, but not game-over. Player tightens budget, focuses on guaranteed income, avoids risky investments temporarily.

### 5.12.2 Death Spiral Prevention

**Preventing Unrecoverable States**:

**Fallback Choices** (Four-choice pattern):
- Always available (no requirements)
- Poor outcome but forward progress
- Prevents soft-locks (can always advance)

**Example**:

A player with zero coins, low health and stamina, and no qualifying stats faces a lodging situation. The stat-gated path requires rapport they lack. The money-gated path requires coins they don't have. The challenge path is risky with depleted resources likely leading to failure. The fallback path to sleep in stables remains always available, guaranteeing forward progress despite poor outcome.

**Safety Nets**:
- Can always take easier deliveries (lower payment, lower risk)
- Can always rest to restore energy (costs time, not resources)
- Can always use fallback choices (poor outcome, but forward progress)

**No Permanent Failure States**: Low resources create difficulty, not impossibility. Player always has path forward, even if suboptimal.

### 5.12.3 Recovery Strategies

**Financial Recovery** (Low Coins):
- Take easier deliveries (safe routes, guaranteed payment)
- Skip optional content (focus on income)
- Accept fallback choices (save coins for survival)
- 3-5 days to rebuild buffer

**Energy Recovery** (Low Health/Stamina/Focus):
- Prioritize rest over activities (spend time blocks on restoration)
- Skip challenges (avoid energy-intensive content)
- Accept suboptimal choices (preserve energy)
- 1-2 days to restore fully

**Reputation Recovery** (Damaged Relationships):
- Gift-giving (spend coins to rebuild relationship)
- Complete NPC requests (invest time to earn favor)
- Avoid further conflicts (prevent additional damage)
- 5-10 interactions to restore positive relationship

**Strategic Depth in Recovery**: Even recovery from failure requires strategic resource management. Cannot instantly fix everything - must prioritize which resources to restore first.
