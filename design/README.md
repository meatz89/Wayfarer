## Design vs Technical Documentation

**Game Design Docs (This Directory)**:
- WHAT the game IS from player perspective
- WHY design decisions create strategic depth
- HOW systems create player experiences
- Player-facing language, no implementation details

**Arc42 Technical Docs (Root Directory)**:
- HOW the system is built
- WHY technical decisions were made
- HOW components interact
- Developer-facing language, implementation focus

**Cross-References**: Both doc sets reference each other extensively.
- Design docs reference arc42 for "See arc42 Section X for technical implementation"
- Arc42 docs reference design for "See design/XX for player experience rationale"

## Quick Start

**New Designer**: Start with [01_design_vision.md](01_design_vision.md) to understand core philosophy

**Content Author**: Read [07_content_generation.md](07_content_generation.md) and [09_design_patterns.md](09_design_patterns.md)

**Balancing**: See [08_balance_philosophy.md](08_balance_philosophy.md)

**All Terms**: Reference [12_design_glossary.md](12_design_glossary.md)

## Total Documentation

- **12 sections**: ~11,700 lines of game design documentation
- **67 terms**: Comprehensive design glossary
- **10 DDRs**: Major design decisions documented
- **21 archetypes**: Complete content generation catalog
