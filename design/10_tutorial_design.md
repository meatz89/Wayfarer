# Section 10: Tutorial Design and Player Guidance

## 10.1 Overview

Wayfarer teaches through natural play within fictional context. Tutorial never announces itself as "tutorial mode." Instead, early authored scenes gradually introduce mechanics while establishing narrative framework. Safety nets ensure early success without feeling artificial.

This section documents:
- **Tutorial Philosophy**: Teach through play, gradual complexity, natural safety nets
- **Authored Tutorial Sequence**: A1-A3 objectives, expandable to A10
- **Layered Complexity Introduction**: First hour, hours 2-3, hours 4-6, hour 6+
- **Perfect Information Display**: How costs, requirements, gaps appear to player
- **Implicit Guidance Mechanisms**: Route learning, bond levels, economic feedback
- **No Hand-Holding**: No quest markers, no optimal paths, no hidden gotchas, no forced tutorial
- **Discovery Rewards**: Route shortcuts, stat synergies, optimization mastery

## 10.2 Tutorial Philosophy

### 10.2.1 Teach Through Natural Play

**Principle**: Player learns by playing game, not by reading instructions or completing disconnected exercises.

**Implementation**:
- Tutorial scenes are real game content (not throwaway training)
- Mechanics introduced through fictional context (you need lodging because you're tired)
- Natural consequences teach systems (spent all coins, now can't afford food)
- Early content remains relevant (relationships formed, locations discovered)

**Not Tutorial Mode**:
- No announcement: "Welcome to tutorial!"
- No disconnected exercises: "Practice combat on dummy"
- No disposable content: "Training area you'll never revisit"
- No explicit instruction: "Press X to jump"

**Example**:

Traditional tutorial (AVOID):

Explicit announcement of tutorial mode with disconnected button-press exercises and throwaway training missions that bear no resemblance to actual gameplay.

Wayfarer tutorial (CORRECT):

Player arrives at a roadside inn at sunset, tired from travel. The innkeeper greets them naturally, asking if they need a room. Choices emerge from the fictional context rather than mechanical instructions. Each action teaches a system while advancing the story. No announcement, no artificial separation from real play.

Player learns by doing. Mechanics emerge from fiction. Nothing announces itself as "tutorial."

### 10.2.2 Gradual Mechanical Introduction

**Principle**: Introduce one concept at a time. Layer complexity as player demonstrates understanding.

**Sequence**:
1. First 30 minutes: Resource display, basic navigation, four-choice pattern
2. Next 30 minutes: First tactical challenge (easy), stat gating introduction
3. Hours 2-3: Economic pressure, relationship building, route learning
4. Hours 4-6: All three challenge types, specialization choices, time pressure
5. Hour 6+: Full complexity, procedural continuation, player-driven priorities

**Not All At Once**:
- Don't present all systems simultaneously
- Don't overwhelm with options
- Don't introduce mechanics player can't use yet
- Don't front-load complex tactical gameplay

**Example Sequence**:

**A1: Arrival at Inn** (30 minutes)
- Teaches: Resource display (Health, Stamina, coins visible)
- Teaches: Four-choice pattern (stat/money/challenge/fallback)
- Teaches: Guaranteed progression (help-for-free path always available)
- Teaches: Navigation (common room → private room → departure)
- Does NOT teach: Tactical challenges (too complex for first scene)

**A2: First Investigation** (30 minutes)
- Teaches: Stat gating (Insight 3 path appears, locked if below)
- Teaches: Perfect information ("Need Insight 3, you have 2")
- Teaches: First Mental challenge (easy difficulty, forgiving)
- Teaches: Challenge basics (ACT/OBSERVE, Progress toward threshold)
- Does NOT teach: All three challenge types (focuses on Mental only)

**A3: Relationship Building** (45 minutes)
- Teaches: NPC bonds (StoryCubes, relationship effects)
- Teaches: Multi-situation scenes (3-4 situations forming arc)
- Teaches: Social challenges (conversation mechanics)
- Teaches: Time blocks (actions consume time, periods advance)
- Does NOT teach: Complex economic trade-offs (margins still generous)

By hour 2, player understands: Resources, four-choice pattern, stat gating, two challenge types, relationships, time. Ready for full game.

### 10.2.3 Safety Nets in Early Content

**Principle**: Early game should teach without punishing. Make success achievable while player learns. Gradually remove training wheels.

**Safety Net Types**:

**Economic Safety Nets**:
- Higher rewards relative to costs (earn 10 coins, lodging costs 6 not 10)
- Cheaper essential services (food 3 coins not 5)
- Generous B-story payouts (10 coins for simple task)
- Forgiving margins (player can make minor mistakes without catastrophe)

**Challenge Safety Nets**:
- Lower victory thresholds (Progress 10 not 15)
- Higher starting resources (Attention 18 not 12)
- Fewer penalty cards (minimal exposure/danger/doubt accumulation)
- Clearer optimal paths (well-telegraphed card synergies)

**Progression Safety Nets**:
- Multiple viable paths (if stat path locked, money path affordable)
- Frequent rest opportunities (recover mistakes easily)
- No expiration pressure (scenes don't expire in tutorial)
- Generous time limits (plenty of segments per day)

**Gradual Removal**:
- By hour 3: Economy tightens (margins get thinner)
- By hour 5: Challenges harder (thresholds increase)
- By hour 8: Full difficulty (tight margins, real trade-offs)

**Why Safety Nets Work**:
- Player learns systems without frustration
- Success feels earned (not trivial, but achievable)
- Confidence builds (I understand how this works)
- Transition smooth (gradual tightening, not sudden difficulty spike)

**Example**:

**A1 Economics** (Tutorial phase):
- Earn 10 coins from simple B-story
- Lodging costs 6 coins (affordable)
- Food costs 3 coins (affordable)
- Player has buffer (comfortable margin)

**Hour 5 Economics** (Safety nets removed):
- Earn 15 coins from moderate B-story
- Lodging costs 12 coins (significant expense)
- Food costs 5 coins (necessary expense)
- Player has minimal buffer (tight margin)

Same proportional difficulty, but tutorial more forgiving. Player learned systems with margin for error.

### 10.2.4 Remove Training Wheels Organically

**Principle**: Don't announce difficulty increase. Let player discover through natural play that margins have tightened.

**Not Announced**:
- No message: "Tutorial complete, difficulty increased"
- No explicit marker: "Entering hard mode"
- No mechanical shift: Sudden stat inflation

**Organic Increase**:
- Costs scale with income (earn 15, costs now 12 instead of 6)
- Situations require more prep (investigations need multiple leads)
- NPCs less generous (demeanor shifts from Friendly to Neutral)
- Time pressure increases (scenes expire, deadlines approach)

**Player Discovery**:
"Hmm, that B-story paid 15 coins but lodging now costs 12. Margins are tighter. I need to be more strategic."

**Example**:

**Tutorial Economics** (A1-A3):

B-story tasks pay modest amounts while lodging and food costs remain low, leaving small but comfortable profit margins for learning players.

**Post-Tutorial Economics** (A4+):

B-story payouts increase proportionally with lodging and food costs, maintaining the same tight profit margins but at higher absolute numbers.

Proportional difficulty maintained, but absolute numbers scaled. Player notices costs increased, realizes margins staying tight, adapts strategy. No announcement needed.

### 10.2.5 Never Punish Experimentation

**Principle**: Player should feel safe trying different approaches. Failure should be learning opportunity, not catastrophe.

**Guaranteed Through**:
- Four-choice pattern (fallback always available)
- No soft-locks (always forward progress)
- Recoverable failures (can retry, use alternative, continue with setback)
- Perfect information (player knows risks before trying)

**Example Safe Experimentation**:

Scene: "Negotiate with merchant"

Player tries Social challenge:
- Cost visible: 3 Resolve (you have 5, will have 2 remaining)
- Success outcome visible: Discount + relationship bonus
- Failure outcome visible: Standard price, no relationship damage

Player attempts, fails challenge:
- Pays standard price (12 coins instead of 8)
- No relationship damage (merchant respects attempt)
- 4 coin penalty (not catastrophic)
- Can recover via B-story earnings

Player learned:
- Social challenges have risk (failure costs more)
- Failure not catastrophic (progressed despite setback)
- Can try again elsewhere (not locked out of challenges)

**Contrast Punishing Design** (FORBIDDEN):

Scene: "Negotiate with merchant"

Player tries Social challenge:
- No outcome preview (hidden consequences)
- Fails challenge
- Merchant permanently hostile (relationship -5)
- Locked out of merchant services for 10 days
- Lost opportunity (can't recover)

Player learned:
- Don't try challenges (punishment too severe)
- Stick to safe paths (afraid of experimentation)
- Consult guide (too risky to explore)

This teaches player to avoid systems instead of engaging with them. Forbidden.

## 10.3 Generalized Patterns Enabling Tutorial

Tutorial experience emerges from general architectural patterns, not special-case tutorial systems. Two key patterns create generous tutorial margins while remaining applicable throughout the game.

### 10.3.1 Categorical Property Scaling (Universal Difficulty Control)

**Architectural Principle**: Difficulty scales through categorical property composition, not explicit difficulty tiers.

**How It Works**:

Every situation archetype defines requirements and rewards using categorical base values. Entity categorical properties (NPCDemeanor, LocationQuality, PowerDynamic, etc.) scale these values universally at spawn-time via catalogue multipliers.

**Categorical Properties That Scale Difficulty**:

1. **NPCDemeanor** (0.6× to 1.4× multipliers):
   - Friendly: 0.6× stat thresholds, 1.2× reward generosity
   - Neutral: 1.0× baseline (no scaling)
   - Suspicious: 1.2× stat thresholds, 0.8× reward generosity
   - Hostile: 1.4× stat thresholds, 0.6× reward generosity

2. **LocationQuality** (cost multipliers):
   - Basic: 0.6× service costs
   - Standard: 1.0× baseline costs
   - Premium: 1.6× service costs
   - Luxury: 2.4× service costs

3. **PowerDynamic** (requirement/reward scaling):
   - PlayerAdvantage: 0.7× requirements, 1.3× rewards
   - Balanced: 1.0× baseline
   - NPCAdvantage: 1.3× requirements, 0.7× rewards

4. **EnvironmentQuality** (challenge difficulty):
   - Favorable: Lower thresholds, higher starting resources
   - Neutral: Baseline values
   - Harsh: Higher thresholds, lower starting resources

**Tutorial Application (ONE Use Case)**:

Tutorial scenes (A1-A3) use specific categorical combinations:
- Elena: Demeanor=Friendly (0.6× stat thresholds)
- Common Room: Quality=Standard (1.0× costs)
- PowerDynamic=Balanced (1.0× requirements)
- EnvironmentQuality=Favorable (easy challenges)

**Result**: Base archetype "SOCIAL_ACQUAINTANCE" requiring Rapport 5 becomes Rapport 3 (5 × 0.6) when spawned with Friendly Elena. Same archetype with Suspicious merchant becomes Rapport 6 (5 × 1.2).

**Post-Tutorial Application (Same Pattern)**:

Later content uses different categorical combinations:
- Merchant: Demeanor=Neutral (1.0× thresholds)
- Premium Inn: Quality=Premium (1.6× costs)
- PowerDynamic=NPCAdvantage (1.3× requirements)
- EnvironmentQuality=Harsh (harder challenges)

**Result**: Same "SOCIAL_ACQUAINTANCE" archetype now requires Rapport 7 (5 × 1.0 × 1.3) with tighter margins. Not a different archetype—same archetype, different properties.

**Key Insight**: Tutorial doesn't need special difficulty tier. It uses GENERAL categorical scaling with Friendly NPCs and Standard locations. Later content uses same archetypes with Neutral/Hostile NPCs and Premium locations. Emergent difficulty from property composition.

**Documentation Location**: Full categorical property catalogue in `design/07_content_generation.md` Section 7.4.

### 10.3.2 Deferred Engagement Pattern (Navigation Without Progression)

**Architectural Principle**: NavigationPayload enables returning to location/NPC without advancing scene state.

**How It Works**:

Choices with ActionType=Navigate and appropriate NavigationPayload can exit current context without marking situation complete. Scene.CurrentSituation remains unchanged. Next player interaction presents same situation again.

**NavigationPayload Structure**: The payload specifies destination type as returning to current location, identifies the current location, and sets no automatic triggering. This structure enables exiting without scene progression.

**Choice Definition Pattern**: The deferred engagement choice displays action text like "Not tonight", uses Navigation path and action types, includes navigation payload returning to current location, provides empty reward template indicating no scene progression, and has empty cost template making navigation free. This pattern enables player exit without commitment.

**Execution Flow**:

1. Player selects "Not tonight" choice
2. ActionType=Navigate triggers navigation flow
3. DestinationType=ReturnToLocation returns to current location
4. RewardTemplate empty = no scene progression applied
5. Scene.CurrentSituation unchanged
6. Scene.CompletedSituations unchanged
7. Player exits to location view
8. Next interaction → same situation presented again

**Tutorial Application (ONE Use Case)**:

A1 Situation 1 (Elena lodging negotiation):
- Choice D: "Not tonight" returns to location
- Player can explore other content
- Elena scene remains active
- Return later to continue negotiation
- Same choices available (nothing consumed)

**Other Applications (Same Pattern)**:

**1. NPC Interaction Postponement**: In a Magistrate Meeting scene, choosing "I need to prepare more thoroughly" returns the player to the location with the scene remaining active, allowing evidence gathering before re-engagement.

**2. Investigation Pause**: In a Mill Investigation scene, choosing "Return to constable for guidance" exits the investigation while keeping it active, enabling pursuit of other leads before returning to complete the investigation.

**3. Challenge Avoidance**: In a Tense Confrontation scene, choosing "Step back, reassess" exits the scene while keeping it available, allowing rest and recovery before re-engagement when ready.

**4. Multi-Visit Requirement**: In a Master Craftsman Training scene, choosing "Practice and return tomorrow" exits for time passage, with the player returning the next day to continue progression through the training sequence.

**Key Insight**: Deferred engagement not a special tutorial state machine. It's GENERAL navigation pattern: ActionType=Navigate + DestinationType=ReturnToLocation + Empty RewardTemplate = exit without progression. Tutorial uses it for "Not tonight," but pattern applicable anywhere player needs pause/return capability.

**Contrast Failed Approaches**:

**❌ Special Deferred State** (Over-engineering): Creating a Scene.SituationLifecycleStatus.Deferred enumeration value, maintaining a Scene.DeferredSituations collection, and building a special state machine to track deferred scenes would add unnecessary architectural complexity.

**✅ Existing Navigation Pattern** (Architectural elegance): NavigationPayload already exists in the architecture, DestinationType already supports ReturnToLocation for location-based navigation, empty RewardTemplate already conveys "no progression" semantically, and no new systems are needed. The pattern emerges from existing architectural primitives.

**Documentation Location**: NavigationPayload details in `05_building_block_view.md` Section 5.3, general navigation patterns in `08_crosscutting_concepts.md` Section 8.6.

### 10.3.3 Why Generalized Patterns Matter

**Tutorial as Emergent Property**:

Tutorial "generous margins" aren't coded separately. They emerge from:
1. Friendly NPCs (existing categorical property)
2. Standard locations (existing categorical property)
3. Balanced power dynamics (existing categorical property)
4. Deferred engagement choices (existing navigation pattern)

**No Special Cases Required**:
- No tutorial_difficulty_tier enum
- No tutorial_mode boolean
- No special tutorial archetypes
- No tutorial-specific code paths

**Post-Tutorial Transition Seamless**:

A3 → A4 transition changes ONLY entity properties:
- NPCs shift from Friendly → Neutral/Suspicious
- Locations shift from Standard → Premium
- Power dynamics shift toward NPCAdvantage
- Same archetypes, same patterns, emergent difficulty increase

**Reusability Throughout Game**:

Same patterns used in non-tutorial contexts:
- Friendly NPC in late game = generous margins (mentor figure)
- Deferred engagement in crisis = tactical retreat option
- Categorical scaling applies to ALL content (tutorial or procedural)

**Architectural Benefit**: Tutorial isn't bolted-on teaching mode. It's first application of general patterns that permeate entire game. Learn patterns in tutorial, recognize patterns throughout game, mastery through pattern recognition.

## 10.4 Authored Tutorial Sequence (A1-A3, Expandable to A10)

### 10.4.1 A1: Arrival at Roadside Inn (30-40 minutes)

**Narrative Context**: Player arrives at roadside inn as sun sets, tired from travel. Need lodging, meet innkeeper Elena, settle in for night. Morning comes, handle what needs handling, prepare to continue journey.

**Mechanical Objectives**:
1. Introduce resource display (Health, Stamina, Focus, coins always visible)
2. Teach four-choice pattern (stat/money/challenge/fallback)
3. Demonstrate guaranteed progression (help path always available)
4. Show perfect information (costs/rewards visible before selection)
5. Introduce basic navigation (common room → private room → departure)
6. Teach time blocks (actions consume segments, periods advance)

**Structure**: 3 situations, linear flow

**Situation 1: Negotiate Lodging** (Common room)
- Choice A: Rapport 3 path (locked for most players, demonstrates stat gating)
- Choice B: Pay 6 coins (affordable, standard path)
- Choice C: Social challenge (NOT available yet, too complex for first scene)
- Choice D: Help clean common room for free room (guaranteed, time-costly)
- Outcome: All paths grant room_key, advance to Situation 2

**Situation 2: Rest and Recover** (Private room, requires room_key)
- Choice A: Balanced rest (Health +15, Stamina +15, Focus +10)
- Choice B: Deep sleep (Health +20, Stamina +25, Focus +5)
- Choice C: Contemplative rest (Health +10, Stamina +10, Focus +20)
- Choice D: Quick rest (Health +10, Stamina +15, immediate departure)
- Outcome: Resources restored, advance to Situation 3

**Situation 3: Morning Departure** (Common room)
- Choice A: Thank innkeeper, build relationship (Elena +1)
- Choice B: Ask about the road ahead (learn about next destination)
- Choice C: Quick departure (minimal interaction, save time)
- Choice D: Offer to help with morning tasks (Elena +2, costs time)
- Outcome: Scene completes, A2 spawns at Westmarch, region unlocked

**What Player Learns**:
- Resources visible and matter (coins, Health, Stamina, Focus)
- Four-choice pattern repeats (stat/money/challenge/fallback)
- Guaranteed path exists (help-for-free always available)
- Perfect information (costs shown before selection)
- Relationships build over time (Elena +1, +2 increments)
- Time is resource (helping costs segments)

**Safety Nets**:
- Only 6 coins needed (earn 10 from starting funds)
- No challenge path (too complex for first scene)
- Generous restoration (recover fully)
- No time pressure (scene doesn't expire)

### 10.4.2 A2: Meet Constable in Westmarch (45-60 minutes)

**Narrative Context**: Arrive in Westmarch, small town with constable's office. Constable investigating mill incident, needs help gathering information. Player conducts first investigation, learns Mental challenge basics.

**Mechanical Objectives**:
1. Introduce stat gating (Insight 3 path visible, shows gap if locked)
2. Teach gap display ("Need Insight 3, you have 2, need 1 more")
3. Introduce first Mental challenge (easy difficulty, forgiving thresholds)
4. Teach challenge basics (ACT/OBSERVE action pair, Progress toward threshold)
5. Show OnSuccess/OnFailure branching (different paths, both advance)
6. Introduce B-stories (side content for resources)

**Structure**: 4 situations, branching structure

**Situation 1: Meet Constable** (Constable's office)
- Choice A: Authority 3 path (demonstrate professional respect)
- Choice B: Pay 5 coins for information access (standard approach)
- Choice C: Insight 3 path (analytic approach, most players locked)
- Choice D: Volunteer to help (guaranteed, establishes cooperative relationship)
- Outcome: All paths grant access, constable explains situation, advance to Situation 2

**Situation 2: Begin Investigation** (Mill exterior)
- Choice A: Insight 3 path (systematic analysis) - MANY PLAYERS LOCKED
- Choice B: Pay worker 8 coins for information (bypass investigation)
- Choice C: Mental challenge (investigate using ACT/OBSERVE mechanics) - TUTORIAL FOR THIS
- Choice D: Ask around slowly (3 time blocks, guaranteed information)
- Outcome:
  - Success paths → Situation 3A (strong evidence)
  - Challenge success → Situation 3A (strong evidence)
  - Challenge failure → Situation 3B (partial evidence)
  - Fallback → Situation 3B (partial evidence)

**Situation 3A: Report Strong Evidence** (Constable's office)
- Present findings, constable impressed
- Gain 2 Understanding, constable relationship +2
- Unlock "competent_investigator" tag
- Advance to Situation 4

**Situation 3B: Report Partial Evidence** (Constable's office)
- Present incomplete findings, constable understanding
- Gain 1 Understanding, constable relationship +1
- No tag granted
- Advance to Situation 4

**Situation 4: Conclude** (Constable's office)
- Constable suggests next destination (Northreach)
- Player receives small payment (10 coins)
- Scene completes, A3 spawns, Northreach region unlocked

**What Player Learns**:
- Stat gating visible (Insight 3 path shows exact requirement)
- Gap display ("Need 1 more Insight to unlock")
- Mental challenges (ACT generates Leads, OBSERVE follows Leads)
- Challenge success/failure both progress (no soft-lock)
- Branching outcomes (strong vs partial evidence)
- B-stories available (can explore Westmarch for resources)

**Safety Nets**:
- Easy Mental challenge (Progress threshold 10, starting Attention 18)
- Failure still advances (partial evidence sufficient)
- Multiple paths (if challenge too hard, use money/fallback)
- No time pressure (investigation doesn't expire)

### 10.4.3 A3: Traveling Scholar Encounter (60-75 minutes)

**Narrative Context**: On road to Northreach, encounter traveling scholar. Scholar injured, needs help. Multi-situation arc: Assess situation, provide aid, build relationship, part ways with mutual respect.

**Mechanical Objectives**:
1. Introduce multi-situation scenes (4 situations forming coherent arc)
2. Teach Social challenges (SPEAK/LISTEN, Momentum/Doubt mechanics)
3. Show relationship building (StoryCubes accumulation)
4. Demonstrate time pressure (scholar needs timely help)
5. Introduce Physical challenges (EXECUTE/ASSESS, Breakthrough/Danger)
6. Show all three challenge types available

**Structure**: 4 situations, linear with conditional paths

**Situation 1: Assess Scholar's Situation** (Roadside)
- Choice A: Insight 4 path (quick diagnosis)
- Choice B: Pay 12 coins for healing supplies (reliable approach)
- Choice C: Cunning 3 path (improvise solution)
- Choice D: Tend carefully without supplies (slow, guaranteed)
- Outcome: Scholar stabilized, advance to Situation 2

**Situation 2: Provide Assistance** (Camp)
- If player has healing supplies: Better options available
- Choice A: Physical challenge (move scholar to shelter)
- Choice B: Social challenge (comfort and reassure scholar)
- Choice C: Pay for cart transport (15 coins, avoid challenges)
- Choice D: Wait for scholar to recover (4 time blocks, safe)
- Outcome: Scholar grateful, advance to Situation 3

**Situation 3: Evening Conversation** (Shelter)
- Scholar shares knowledge, builds rapport
- Choice A: Rapport 4 path (deep conversation, best bond)
- Choice B: Ask about journey (standard conversation)
- Choice C: Social challenge (earn scholar's trust)
- Choice D: Rest separately (minimal interaction)
- Outcome: Scholar relationship +1 to +3 (depends on path), advance to Situation 4

**Situation 4: Morning Departure** (Roadside)
- Scholar offers gift: Training opportunity OR rare item
- Choice A: Accept training (stat +1, costs time)
- Choice B: Accept item (useful equipment)
- Choice C: Decline politely (scholar appreciates humility)
- Choice D: Suggest traveling together (scholar +2, costs time)
- Outcome: Scene completes, procedural continuation triggered

**What Player Learns**:
- Multi-situation arcs (4 situations forming complete story)
- Social challenges (SPEAK/LISTEN, Momentum toward goal)
- Physical challenges (EXECUTE/ASSESS, Breakthrough toward victory)
- All three challenge types available (Mental from A2, Social/Physical here)
- Relationship building meaningful (scholar bond unlocks benefits)
- Time pressure real (scholar needs timely help, delays matter)
- Procedural continuation begins (A4+ generated procedurally)

**Safety Nets**:
- Challenges optional (can use money/fallback paths)
- Failure not catastrophic (scholar understanding even if help imperfect)
- Multiple relationship paths (conversation OR challenge OR time investment)
- Generous rewards (training OR item OR enhanced relationship)

### 10.4.4 Post-A3: Procedural Continuation

After A3 completes, procedural generation takes over. A4+ scenes generated using archetypes + categorical properties + AI narrative enrichment.

**Transition**:
- No announcement ("Tutorial complete")
- Seamless shift (A4 feels like natural continuation)
- Same structural guarantees (four-choice pattern, no soft-locks)
- Expanding scope (local → regional → continental → cosmic)

**What Changes**:
- Content generation (procedural not authored)
- Margins tighten (safety nets removed)
- Time pressure increases (scenes expire)
- Economic pressure (tight margins maintained)
- Complexity deepens (multi-system interactions)

**What Stays Same**:
- Four-choice pattern (guaranteed progression)
- Perfect information (costs visible)
- Build diversity (all specializations viable)
- Strategic depth (resource trade-offs)

### 10.4.5 Expandable to A10 (Future Development)

Current architecture supports expanding tutorial to A10+ authored scenes before procedural continuation.

**Potential A4-A10 Objectives**:
- A4: First faction encounter (faction relationships, reputation)
- A5: Route travel with Scenes (travel interruptions, route events)
- A6: Economic crisis (tight margins, bankruptcy recovery)
- A7: Training systems (NPC bonds unlock training)
- A8: Item systems (equipment, crafting, supplies)
- A9: Calendar events (seasonal changes, timed opportunities)
- A10: Tactical mastery (complex card synergies, advanced strategies)

**Design Flexibility**: Can extend tutorial as long as needed to teach systems. Procedural continuation triggers after final authored scene.

## 10.5 Layered Complexity Introduction

### 10.5.1 First Hour: Strategic Layer Only

**What's Introduced**:
- Resource display (Health, Stamina, Focus, coins, time)
- Four-choice pattern (stat/money/challenge/fallback)
- Perfect information (costs/rewards visible)
- Basic navigation (location → spot → location)
- Guaranteed progression (fallback paths always available)

**What's NOT Introduced**:
- Tactical challenges (too complex)
- Economic pressure (margins generous)
- Time pressure (no expirations)
- Complex multi-system interactions

**Player Experience**: "I understand resources, I see my options, I can make informed choices. This is comfortable."

**Example Scene Structure**:

In a lodging negotiation situation, the player sees their current resources clearly displayed alongside four choices with explicit costs. The stat-gated path shows it's locked with exact gap information. The money path shows current and projected coin amounts. The fallback path shows time cost and progression guarantee. Every choice presents complete information about current state versus projected outcome.

### 10.5.2 Hours 2-3: First Tactical Challenges (Social Only)

**What's Introduced**:
- First challenge type (Social only, not all three)
- Challenge basics (Action/Foundation/Discard pattern)
- Resource management (Initiative from Foundation cards)
- Victory thresholds (Momentum ≥ 12, Doubt < 10)
- Session resources (Resolve consumed when entering)

**What's NOT Introduced**:
- All three challenge types (just Social)
- Complex card synergies (straightforward paths)
- High difficulty (forgiving thresholds)
- Multiple simultaneous challenges

**Safety Nets**:
- Lower Doubt threshold (10 not 8)
- Higher starting Resolve (15 not 12)
- Clearer optimal paths (well-telegraphed)
- Generous Momentum accumulation

**Player Experience**: "Okay, challenges have more complexity. I play cards, build Initiative, accumulate Momentum. I can see the path to victory."

**Example Challenge Structure**:

In a social challenge to persuade an innkeeper, victory requires accumulating sufficient momentum while keeping doubt low. Players start with resolve but no initiative. They must play foundation cards to generate initiative, then spend that initiative on speak cards to build momentum. Listen cards help draw more options and reset tempo. Through several turns of careful resource management and card play, players reach the victory threshold while maintaining safe doubt levels.

### 10.5.3 Hours 4-6: All Three Challenge Types, Specialization Matters

**What's Introduced**:
- Mental challenges (ACT/OBSERVE, Progress/Exposure)
- Physical challenges (EXECUTE/ASSESS, Breakthrough/Danger)
- All three challenge types accessible
- Specialization choices (which stats to build)
- Stat synergies visible (high Insight improves Mental challenges)

**What's NOT Introduced**:
- Full economic pressure (still slightly generous)
- Extreme time pressure (expirations but lenient)
- Advanced card synergies (complex combos)

**Safety Nets Mostly Removed**:
- Challenge thresholds near final values (Progress 13 not 15, but close)
- Economy approaching final tightness (earn 15, spend 13)
- Time pressure increasing (some expirations, but generous windows)

**Player Experience**: "I'm making build choices. My high Insight helps Mental challenges. My low Authority makes confrontation harder. I'm specializing."

**Example Specialization Impact**:

Player A (Insight 5, Authority 2):

Strong specialization in insight grants many stat-gated cards for mental challenges, standard access to physical challenges, but limited options for authority-based social challenges.

Player B (Authority 5, Insight 2):

Strong specialization in authority provides limited mental challenge options, standard physical challenge access, but many stat-gated cards for authority-based social challenges.

Different strengths. Different weaknesses. Specialization creating build identity.

### 10.5.4 Hour 6+: Full Complexity, Procedural Continuation, Player-Driven Priorities

**What's Introduced**:
- Full economic pressure (tight margins)
- Full time pressure (frequent expirations)
- Advanced card synergies (complex combos)
- Multi-system interactions (economy + time + challenges)
- Procedural A-story continuation (infinite content)

**All Safety Nets Removed**:
- Challenge thresholds final (Progress 15, Doubt 8)
- Economy final (earn 18, premium lodging 12, margins tight)
- Time pressure final (expirations frequent, deadlines real)

**Player Experience**: "Every decision matters. Resources tight. Time scarce. Build specialization critical. I'm optimizing constantly."

**Example Full Complexity**:

Player situation:

With moderate coins but depleted health, stamina, and focus, facing an impending main story deadline and an expiring side story opportunity, the player must make complex strategic calculations. Resting requires time and coins. The main story needs resolve and time. The lucrative side story expires soon. Basic survival needs food.

Three strategic options present themselves: prioritize rest and risk losing the side story, attempt the side story first then squeeze in everything else on a tight schedule, or push through the main story with low health and recover afterward. Each option involves trade-offs between resource preservation, deadline management, and risk tolerance.

Choosing the aggressive middle option, the player spends their morning on the side story for coins, midday resting to recover resources, afternoon advancing the main plot, and evening handling survival needs. Every segment allocated, every coin accounted for, optimization essential for success.

Tight margins. Every choice matters. Optimization critical.

## 10.6 Perfect Information Display

### 10.6.1 Costs and Rewards Visible Before Selection

**Display Pattern**: Every choice shows exact costs, exact rewards, exact requirements, exact gaps.

**Cost Display**:

Costs show resource deductions with current amounts and projected amounts after the action, including coins spent, stamina consumed, and time blocks required.

**Reward Display**:

Rewards show resource gains with current amounts and projected amounts after the action, including health restored, understanding gained, and relationship improvements.

**Requirement Display (Locked)**:

Locked choices show the exact stat requirement, the player's current stat value, and the precise gap between them.

**Requirement Display (Met)**:

Met requirements show the stat threshold, the player's current value exceeding it, and unlocked status confirmation.

**Why This Works**:
- Player calculates exact outcome
- No surprises after commitment
- Strategic planning possible
- Resource management transparent

### 10.6.2 Stat Thresholds Show Current Value and Gap

**Pattern**: When stat-gated choice locked, show exact requirement and exact gap.

**Example Displays**:

**Gap 1** (Close):

A choice requiring one more point than the player possesses, showing they're almost qualified and a single training session or equipment piece would unlock it.

**Gap 3** (Far):

A choice requiring three more points than the player possesses, indicating significant stat investment needed to unlock this path.

**Met**:

A choice where the player exceeds the requirement by two points, clearly indicating full qualification and unlocked access.

**Why Gaps Matter**:
- Player can plan: "I'm 1 point away, next training session unlocks this"
- Encourages strategic stat investment
- Shows progress toward unlocking paths
- Never mystery gate ("need high stat" too vague)

### 10.6.3 Locked Choices Visible with Requirement Paths

**Principle**: Show locked choices, explain why locked, show how to unlock.

**Display Pattern**:

**Locked Choice Example**:

A locked choice for systematic evidence analysis displays the insight requirement, the player's current insight value, and the two-point gap. It also shows multiple paths to unlocking: training with a scholar for coins and time, completing investigation side stories to gain experience points for allocation, or acquiring equipment that boosts insight while equipped.

**Why Show Locked**:
- Player sees possibilities (knows what they're missing)
- Requirement Inversion Principle (content exists, requirements filter)
- Motivates character building (I want to unlock that path)
- No mystery gates (clear path to unlocking)

### 10.6.4 Resource Changes Immediate and Clear

**Pattern**: After selection, resource changes apply immediately and visibly.

**Before Selection**:

The player sees their current resource state with coins, health, stamina, and time clearly displayed. The rest action shows exact costs in coins and time segments, plus exact rewards in health and stamina restoration.

**After Selection**:

Resource values update immediately to reflect the promised changes. Coins decrease by the stated amount, health and stamina increase by the stated amounts, and time advances by the consumed segments. Changes are briefly highlighted to draw attention to the state transition.

**Why Immediate Feedback**:
- Player sees consequences clearly
- Resource accounting transparent
- No hidden deductions
- Builds trust (game does what it says)

### 10.6.5 Challenge Difficulty Visible Before Entry

**Pattern**: Before entering challenge, show difficulty indicators.

**Mental Challenge Display**:

A mill investigation challenge preview shows the mental challenge type using act and observe mechanics, victory threshold requiring progress accumulation, danger from exposure increasing over time, entry cost in time blocks, estimated focus consumption range, and the player's advantage from high insight unlocking many stat-gated cards. Overall difficulty assessed as moderate and within player capability.

**Social Challenge Display**:

A magistrate persuasion challenge preview shows the social challenge type using speak and listen mechanics, dual victory conditions of momentum accumulation and doubt management, danger from the magistrate losing patience at the doubt threshold, entry cost in resolve, the player's rapport advantage unlocking some stat-gated cards, and their authority disadvantage limiting authority-based options. Overall difficulty assessed as challenging with mixed advantages and disadvantages.

**Why Preview Matters**:
- Player decides WHETHER to attempt (strategic choice)
- Knows risks before committing
- Can prepare (rest, acquire supplies, build stats)
- No surprise difficulty spikes

## 10.7 Implicit Guidance Mechanisms

### 10.7.1 Route Segment Counts Visible

**Unknown Route** (First visit):

An unexplored northern road shows estimated distance range, expected wilderness dangers, approximate time cost, and stamina consumption range. Uncertainty requires maintaining resource buffers for unexpected challenges.

**Known Route** (After first journey):

After completing the journey once, the northern road displays exact segment count, precise positions of dangerous segments, exact time cost, precise stamina consumption per segment, and known random event location. Complete information enables precise planning and optimization.

**What Player Learns**:
- Route learning reduces uncertainty
- Known routes enable optimization
- First journey teaches route structure
- Subsequent journeys more efficient

**Guidance**: Travel routes multiple times to master efficient navigation.

### 10.7.2 Fixed Environmental Segments Face-Up After First Visit

**First Visit** (Unknown):

An unexplored route segment presents unknown terrain and challenges, requiring cautious exploration without foreknowledge.

**Second Visit** (Known):

After initial exploration, the segment reveals its forest terrain and physical obstacle location, allowing appropriate preparation for subsequent journeys.

**What Player Learns**:
- First journey is exploration (discovery)
- Subsequent journeys are optimized (knowledge)
- Some segments random, some fixed
- Fixed segments learned, random segments always variable

**Guidance**: Master high-traffic routes for efficient repeated travel.

### 10.7.3 NPC Bond Levels Show Mechanical Benefits

**Bond Display**:

Elena the innkeeper shows bond level three representing strong friendship. Current benefits include lodging discount from six to four coins, one free meal daily, and freely shared rumors and information. The next tier at bond level five will unlock training opportunities. Bond improvement paths include helping with inn tasks for one bond point, bringing requested items for two bond points, or completing related side stories for one bond point.

**What Player Learns**:
- Bonds have mechanical benefits (not just narrative)
- Higher bonds unlock more benefits
- Clear path to improving bonds
- Investment in relationships pays off

**Guidance**: Build bonds with NPCs strategically based on services needed.

### 10.7.4 Economic Feedback Loop (Profit Margins Signal Optimization)

**Suboptimal Play**:

Side story earnings of fifteen coins fail to cover expenses totaling twenty coins from premium lodging, food, and inefficient travel, creating a five-coin deficit. Warning feedback signals the need for strategy adjustment.

**Optimal Play**:

Increased side story earnings of eighteen coins combined with reduced expenses from basic lodging, standard food, and efficient travel totaling fifteen coins creates a sustainable three-coin surplus. Comfortable margins maintained through optimization.

**What Player Learns**:
- Premium options expensive (luxury lodging 40 coins)
- Basic options adequate (basic lodging 8 coins)
- Optimization matters (travel efficiency, lodging choice)
- Sustainable margins achievable with planning

**Guidance**: Track profit margins. Adjust spending if running deficits.

### 10.7.5 Challenge Difficulty Shows Stat Requirements

**Mental Challenge Card** (Before Entry):

A systematic analysis card requiring insight of at least five shows its powerful effects of adding six progress and generating three leads, but displays locked status because the player's insight of three falls short. The two-point gap is visible during challenge preview.

**After Training** (Insight 5):

After training to reach insight five, the same systematic analysis card now shows unlocked status and becomes available for use during mental challenges.

**What Player Learns**:
- Higher stats unlock better cards
- Specialization improves challenge performance
- Can preview cards before entering (informed decision)
- Training investment pays off in tactical layer

**Guidance**: Build stats aligned with preferred challenge types.

## 10.8 No Hand-Holding

### 10.8.1 No Quest Markers

**Not Present**:
- Glowing indicators showing "go here"
- Arrows pointing to objectives
- Automatic waypoints to quest locations
- Mandatory tutorial sequences

**What Exists Instead**:
- Narrative hints: NPCs mention locations
- Perfect information: Requirements visible
- State-based discovery: Content appears when eligible
- Player exploration: Find opportunities naturally

**Example**:

Traditional RPG (AVOID):

Glowing quest markers, arrows pointing to objectives on the map, automatic waypoint routing, and mandatory completion requirements that remove player agency.

Wayfarer (CORRECT):

The constable mentions strange occurrences at the old mill as a conversational narrative hint. The mill appears on the map as a discovered location without markers or arrows. The player decides whether to investigate immediately, later, or pursue entirely different content. No mandatory sequence, no hand-holding guidance.

**Why No Markers**:
- Player explores naturally (not following instructions)
- Discovery feels earned (not directed)
- Multiple paths available (not linear progression)
- Agency preserved (player decides priorities)

### 10.8.2 No Optimal Path Highlighting

**Not Present**:
- Recommended choices marked
- "Best" option indicated
- Difficulty color-coding (easy/hard)
- Success rate percentages

**What Exists Instead**:
- Perfect information (costs/rewards visible)
- Requirement transparency (stat thresholds shown)
- Player calculates optimal (based on resources and priorities)
- Context determines best choice (no universal optimal)

**Example**:

Hand-Holding Design (AVOID):

Choices labeled with recommendations, difficulty ratings, success percentages, and explicit fallback markers that tell players what to choose instead of letting them decide.

Wayfarer Design (CORRECT):

Each choice displays exact requirements with the player's current values, precise costs with resource availability, clear outcomes for both success and failure, and complete information enabling informed player judgment about which path suits their current situation and priorities.

**Why No Highlighting**:
- Player makes informed decisions (not following instructions)
- Optimal varies by context (no universal best)
- Build diversity (different builds prefer different paths)
- Skill expression (optimization is player skill)

### 10.8.3 No Hidden Gotchas

**Not Present**:
- Surprise consequences after commitment
- Hidden requirements discovered after attempt
- Unadvertised resource deductions
- Locked content with unclear requirements

**What Exists Instead**:
- Perfect information principle (all visible)
- Consequences shown before selection
- Requirements transparent (exact thresholds)
- Clear paths to unlocking (visible progression)

**Example**:

Hidden Gotcha (FORBIDDEN):

A choice displays only the immediate benefit of gaining assistance while hiding reputation loss, tag application, and content path blocking. Players discover these consequences only after commitment, creating feelings of unfairness and betrayal.

Perfect Information (CORRECT):

A choice displays immediate assistance gained, explicit reputation cost and tag application, clear future impact on which scene paths open or close, and the fundamental trade-off between power and principles. Players see the complete exchange before making their decision.

**Why No Gotchas**:
- Player makes informed decisions (not guessing)
- Trust maintained (game does what it says)
- Experimentation safe (no surprise punishments)
- Strategic planning possible (calculate outcomes)

### 10.8.4 No Punishment for Experimentation

**Design Guarantees**:
- Four-choice pattern (fallback always available)
- Challenge failure advances (setback, not block)
- Resources recoverable (can earn more coins, restore Health)
- No permanent lockouts (builds remain viable)

**Example Safe Experimentation**:

Player tries expensive choice:

Spending twenty coins on premium service with only twenty-two coins available leaves just two coins remaining, creating very tight margins but remaining recoverable through side story earnings.

Player recovers:

Completing a side story earns eighteen coins, restoring the player to twenty coins and comfortable margins again. The experimentation had a cost but proved fully recoverable through normal gameplay.

**Why Experimentation Encouraged**:
- Failure not catastrophic (can recover)
- Learning valuable (understand systems)
- Discovery rewarded (find efficient paths)
- Player agency (safe to try approaches)

### 10.8.5 No Forced Tutorial

**Design Flexibility**:
- Can skip A1-A3 if experienced (jump to A4+)
- Can replay tutorial scenes if needed (re-learn systems)
- Can explore B-stories before A-story (no forced sequence)
- Can build character as preferred (no mandatory path)

**How Skipping Works**:

New player:

Progresses through the authored tutorial sequence from basic mechanics in A1, to investigation in A2, to relationship building in A3, before entering the full procedural game at A4 and beyond.

Experienced player:

Skips the tutorial entirely and jumps directly to full game complexity at A4 and beyond, assuming system familiarity from previous playthroughs or experience with similar games.

**Why Optional**:
- Respects experienced players (no tedious rehash)
- Onboarding for new players (gradual learning)
- Replayability (skip on subsequent playthroughs)
- Player agency (choose engagement level)

## 10.9 Discovery Rewards

### 10.9.1 Route Shortcuts from NPC Bonds

**Pattern**: Building relationship with NPC unlocks shortcut routes.

**Example**:

Initial route:

The land route between Westmarch and Northreach spans six segments requiring three time blocks and consuming twelve stamina.

After building bond with Elena (level 5):

Elena offers a letter of introduction to her cousin's ferry service, unlocking a shortcut route. The ferry covers the same journey in only two segments requiring one time block, but costs eight coins for the fare plus four stamina. The trade-off exchanges coin cost for significant time and stamina savings.

**What Player Learns**:
- Relationships unlock alternatives
- Shortcuts have trade-offs (coin cost vs time/stamina savings)
- Investment in NPCs pays off mechanically
- Strategic relationship building matters

**Guidance**: Build bonds with NPCs in high-traffic areas for travel shortcuts.

### 10.9.2 Stat Synergies Discovered Through Play

**Pattern**: Player discovers stat combinations unlock better paths.

**Example Discovery**:

Player with Insight 6, Cunning 5:

High specialization in both investigation stats unlocks all three optimal paths: systematic analysis requiring insight six, subtle observation requiring cunning five, and intuitive deduction requiring both insight six and cunning four. Specialization payoff maximized with multiple accessible paths.

Player with Insight 4, Cunning 4:

Moderate generalist stats lock all three optimal paths, forcing reliance on expensive money paths, risky challenge paths, or time-consuming fallback paths. Generalist build sacrifices optimal path access for broader capability coverage.

**What Player Learns**:
- Specialization unlocks more paths
- Stat combinations create synergies
- Focused builds have advantages
- Generalist builds sacrifice accessibility for flexibility

**Guidance**: Specialize in 2-3 stats for consistent path access.

### 10.9.3 Economic Optimization Mastery

**Pattern**: Player discovers efficient spending patterns.

**Novice Economy**:

Earning fifteen coins per side story but spending twenty-five coins on premium lodging, restaurant meals, and carriage travel creates a ten-coin deficit and unsustainable economic collapse.

**Expert Economy**:

The same fifteen-coin income but optimized spending on basic six-coin lodging, standard five-coin food, and zero-coin foot travel totals only eleven coins for a sustainable four-coin surplus. Premium options reserved strategically for emergencies: premium lodging when health becomes critical, premium food when time scarcity demands efficiency, and carriage transport when stamina depletion requires recovery alternatives.

**What Player Learns**:
- Basic options adequate (not inferior)
- Premium options situational (emergency or efficiency)
- Sustainable margins through optimization
- Strategic spending beats habitual premium

**Guidance**: Use basic options routinely, premium options strategically.

### 10.9.4 Tactical Skill Improvement

**Pattern**: Challenge success rates improve with card play skill.

**Novice Tactical Play**:

Inefficient card sequencing generates leads piecemeal without sufficient attention management, wastes turns with suboptimal plays, and observes prematurely with too few accumulated leads. The result achieves only eight of fifteen required progress, failing the challenge through poor resource management.

**Expert Tactical Play**:

Strategic card sequencing accumulates five leads before observing to maximize detail draw efficiency. High-value action cards build progress efficiently toward the threshold, with careful resource management enabling victory at sixteen progress through optimized lead generation, observation timing, and progress building.

**What Player Learns**:
- Lead accumulation matters (maximize before OBSERVE)
- Card sequencing matters (Foundation before expensive cards)
- Resource management (don't waste Attention)
- Victory thresholds reachable (optimization enables success)

**Guidance**: Accumulate builder resources before spending session resources.

### 10.9.5 Archetype Pattern Recognition

**Pattern**: Player recognizes repeating patterns, predicts structure.

**After Multiple Services**:

Player recognizes service flow pattern:

After encountering several service scenes, the player identifies the three-phase structure of negotiation with four-choice pattern, execution with recovery focus selection, and departure with relationship versus speed trade-off. Pattern recognition enables efficient decision-making: negotiate with coins to preserve stats, select mental-focused recovery to restore needed focus, and quick departure to save time.

**After Multiple Investigations**:

Player recognizes investigation pattern:

After multiple investigation scenes, the player identifies the hub-and-spoke structure with multiple parallel leads, convergence point for presenting evidence, and conclusion quality dependent on evidence completeness. Pattern recognition guides strategy: explore all three leads to gather maximum evidence, return to convergence with complete picture, and achieve optimal conclusion for best understanding gain through thorough investigation worth the time investment.

**What Player Learns**:
- Patterns repeat across game (reusable mental models)
- Structure predictable (can plan ahead)
- Archetypes have conventions (four choices, three phases)
- Recognition enables optimization (efficient decision-making)

**Guidance**: Learn archetype patterns for faster strategic planning.
