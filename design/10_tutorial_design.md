# Section 10: Tutorial Design and Player Guidance

## 10.1 Overview

Wayfarer teaches through natural play within fictional context. Tutorial never announces itself as "tutorial mode." Instead, early authored scenes gradually introduce mechanics while establishing narrative framework. Safety nets ensure early success without feeling artificial.

This section documents:
- **Tutorial Philosophy**: Teach through play, gradual complexity, natural safety nets
- **Authored Tutorial Sequence**: A1-A3 objectives, expandable to A10
- **Layered Complexity Introduction**: First hour, hours 2-3, hours 4-6, hour 6+
- **Perfect Information Display**: How costs, requirements, gaps appear to player
- **Implicit Guidance Mechanisms**: Route learning, bond levels, economic feedback
- **No Hand-Holding**: No quest markers, no optimal paths, no hidden gotchas, no forced tutorial
- **Discovery Rewards**: Route shortcuts, stat synergies, optimization mastery

## 10.2 Tutorial Philosophy

### 10.2.1 Teach Through Natural Play

**Principle**: Player learns by playing game, not by reading instructions or completing disconnected exercises.

**Implementation**:
- Tutorial scenes are real game content (not throwaway training)
- Mechanics introduced through fictional context (you need lodging because you're tired)
- Natural consequences teach systems (spent all coins, now can't afford food)
- Early content remains relevant (relationships formed, locations discovered)

**Not Tutorial Mode**:
- No announcement: "Welcome to tutorial!"
- No disconnected exercises: "Practice combat on dummy"
- No disposable content: "Training area you'll never revisit"
- No explicit instruction: "Press X to jump"

**Example**:

Traditional tutorial (AVOID):
```
TUTORIAL MODE
Press A to talk to NPC.
Press B to view inventory.
Press X to open map.
Complete training mission.
```

Wayfarer tutorial (CORRECT):
```
You arrive at roadside inn as sun sets. You're tired from travel.
Innkeeper greets you: "Need a room for the night?"

[Four choices displayed]
- Talk with innkeeper (learn negotiation)
- Check your coins (see resource display)
- Look around common room (observe world)
- Ask about the road ahead (gather information)
```

Player learns by doing. Mechanics emerge from fiction. Nothing announces itself as "tutorial."

### 10.2.2 Gradual Mechanical Introduction

**Principle**: Introduce one concept at a time. Layer complexity as player demonstrates understanding.

**Sequence**:
1. First 30 minutes: Resource display, basic navigation, four-choice pattern
2. Next 30 minutes: First tactical challenge (easy), stat gating introduction
3. Hours 2-3: Economic pressure, relationship building, route learning
4. Hours 4-6: All three challenge types, specialization choices, time pressure
5. Hour 6+: Full complexity, procedural continuation, player-driven priorities

**Not All At Once**:
- Don't present all systems simultaneously
- Don't overwhelm with options
- Don't introduce mechanics player can't use yet
- Don't front-load complex tactical gameplay

**Example Sequence**:

**A1: Arrival at Inn** (30 minutes)
- Teaches: Resource display (Health, Stamina, coins visible)
- Teaches: Four-choice pattern (stat/money/challenge/fallback)
- Teaches: Guaranteed progression (help-for-free path always available)
- Teaches: Navigation (common room → private room → departure)
- Does NOT teach: Tactical challenges (too complex for first scene)

**A2: First Investigation** (30 minutes)
- Teaches: Stat gating (Insight 3 path appears, locked if below)
- Teaches: Perfect information ("Need Insight 3, you have 2")
- Teaches: First Mental challenge (easy difficulty, forgiving)
- Teaches: Challenge basics (ACT/OBSERVE, Progress toward threshold)
- Does NOT teach: All three challenge types (focuses on Mental only)

**A3: Relationship Building** (45 minutes)
- Teaches: NPC bonds (StoryCubes, relationship effects)
- Teaches: Multi-situation scenes (3-4 situations forming arc)
- Teaches: Social challenges (conversation mechanics)
- Teaches: Time blocks (actions consume time, periods advance)
- Does NOT teach: Complex economic trade-offs (margins still generous)

By hour 2, player understands: Resources, four-choice pattern, stat gating, two challenge types, relationships, time. Ready for full game.

### 10.2.3 Safety Nets in Early Content

**Principle**: Early game should teach without punishing. Make success achievable while player learns. Gradually remove training wheels.

**Safety Net Types**:

**Economic Safety Nets**:
- Higher rewards relative to costs (earn 10 coins, lodging costs 6 not 10)
- Cheaper essential services (food 3 coins not 5)
- Generous B-story payouts (10 coins for simple task)
- Forgiving margins (player can make minor mistakes without catastrophe)

**Challenge Safety Nets**:
- Lower victory thresholds (Progress 10 not 15)
- Higher starting resources (Attention 18 not 12)
- Fewer penalty cards (minimal exposure/danger/doubt accumulation)
- Clearer optimal paths (well-telegraphed card synergies)

**Progression Safety Nets**:
- Multiple viable paths (if stat path locked, money path affordable)
- Frequent rest opportunities (recover mistakes easily)
- No expiration pressure (scenes don't expire in tutorial)
- Generous time limits (plenty of segments per day)

**Gradual Removal**:
- By hour 3: Economy tightens (margins get thinner)
- By hour 5: Challenges harder (thresholds increase)
- By hour 8: Full difficulty (tight margins, real trade-offs)

**Why Safety Nets Work**:
- Player learns systems without frustration
- Success feels earned (not trivial, but achievable)
- Confidence builds (I understand how this works)
- Transition smooth (gradual tightening, not sudden difficulty spike)

**Example**:

**A1 Economics** (Tutorial phase):
- Earn 10 coins from simple B-story
- Lodging costs 6 coins (affordable)
- Food costs 3 coins (affordable)
- Player has buffer (comfortable margin)

**Hour 5 Economics** (Safety nets removed):
- Earn 15 coins from moderate B-story
- Lodging costs 12 coins (significant expense)
- Food costs 5 coins (necessary expense)
- Player has minimal buffer (tight margin)

Same proportional difficulty, but tutorial more forgiving. Player learned systems with margin for error.

### 10.2.4 Remove Training Wheels Organically

**Principle**: Don't announce difficulty increase. Let player discover through natural play that margins have tightened.

**Not Announced**:
- No message: "Tutorial complete, difficulty increased"
- No explicit marker: "Entering hard mode"
- No mechanical shift: Sudden stat inflation

**Organic Increase**:
- Costs scale with income (earn 15, costs now 12 instead of 6)
- Situations require more prep (investigations need multiple leads)
- NPCs less generous (demeanor shifts from Friendly to Neutral)
- Time pressure increases (scenes expire, deadlines approach)

**Player Discovery**:
"Hmm, that B-story paid 15 coins but lodging now costs 12. Margins are tighter. I need to be more strategic."

**Example**:

**Tutorial Economics** (A1-A3):
```
B-story payout: 10 coins
Lodging cost: 6 coins
Food cost: 3 coins
Net: +1 coin (small profit)
```

**Post-Tutorial Economics** (A4+):
```
B-story payout: 18 coins
Lodging cost: 12 coins
Food cost: 5 coins
Net: +1 coin (same small profit)
```

Proportional difficulty maintained, but absolute numbers scaled. Player notices costs increased, realizes margins staying tight, adapts strategy. No announcement needed.

### 10.2.5 Never Punish Experimentation

**Principle**: Player should feel safe trying different approaches. Failure should be learning opportunity, not catastrophe.

**Guaranteed Through**:
- Four-choice pattern (fallback always available)
- No soft-locks (always forward progress)
- Recoverable failures (can retry, use alternative, continue with setback)
- Perfect information (player knows risks before trying)

**Example Safe Experimentation**:

Scene: "Negotiate with merchant"

Player tries Social challenge:
- Cost visible: 3 Resolve (you have 5, will have 2 remaining)
- Success outcome visible: Discount + relationship bonus
- Failure outcome visible: Standard price, no relationship damage

Player attempts, fails challenge:
- Pays standard price (12 coins instead of 8)
- No relationship damage (merchant respects attempt)
- 4 coin penalty (not catastrophic)
- Can recover via B-story earnings

Player learned:
- Social challenges have risk (failure costs more)
- Failure not catastrophic (progressed despite setback)
- Can try again elsewhere (not locked out of challenges)

**Contrast Punishing Design** (FORBIDDEN):

Scene: "Negotiate with merchant"

Player tries Social challenge:
- No outcome preview (hidden consequences)
- Fails challenge
- Merchant permanently hostile (relationship -5)
- Locked out of merchant services for 10 days
- Lost opportunity (can't recover)

Player learned:
- Don't try challenges (punishment too severe)
- Stick to safe paths (afraid of experimentation)
- Consult guide (too risky to explore)

This teaches player to avoid systems instead of engaging with them. Forbidden.

## 10.3 Authored Tutorial Sequence (A1-A3, Expandable to A10)

### 10.3.1 A1: Arrival at Roadside Inn (30-40 minutes)

**Narrative Context**: Player arrives at roadside inn as sun sets, tired from travel. Need lodging, meet innkeeper Elena, settle in for night. Morning comes, handle what needs handling, prepare to continue journey.

**Mechanical Objectives**:
1. Introduce resource display (Health, Stamina, Focus, coins always visible)
2. Teach four-choice pattern (stat/money/challenge/fallback)
3. Demonstrate guaranteed progression (help path always available)
4. Show perfect information (costs/rewards visible before selection)
5. Introduce basic navigation (common room → private room → departure)
6. Teach time blocks (actions consume segments, periods advance)

**Structure**: 3 situations, linear flow

**Situation 1: Negotiate Lodging** (Common room)
- Choice A: Rapport 3 path (locked for most players, demonstrates stat gating)
- Choice B: Pay 6 coins (affordable, standard path)
- Choice C: Social challenge (NOT available yet, too complex for first scene)
- Choice D: Help clean common room for free room (guaranteed, time-costly)
- Outcome: All paths grant room_key, advance to Situation 2

**Situation 2: Rest and Recover** (Private room, requires room_key)
- Choice A: Balanced rest (Health +15, Stamina +15, Focus +10)
- Choice B: Deep sleep (Health +20, Stamina +25, Focus +5)
- Choice C: Contemplative rest (Health +10, Stamina +10, Focus +20)
- Choice D: Quick rest (Health +10, Stamina +15, immediate departure)
- Outcome: Resources restored, advance to Situation 3

**Situation 3: Morning Departure** (Common room)
- Choice A: Thank innkeeper, build relationship (Elena +1)
- Choice B: Ask about the road ahead (learn about next destination)
- Choice C: Quick departure (minimal interaction, save time)
- Choice D: Offer to help with morning tasks (Elena +2, costs time)
- Outcome: Scene completes, A2 spawns at Westmarch, region unlocked

**What Player Learns**:
- Resources visible and matter (coins, Health, Stamina, Focus)
- Four-choice pattern repeats (stat/money/challenge/fallback)
- Guaranteed path exists (help-for-free always available)
- Perfect information (costs shown before selection)
- Relationships build over time (Elena +1, +2 increments)
- Time is resource (helping costs segments)

**Safety Nets**:
- Only 6 coins needed (earn 10 from starting funds)
- No challenge path (too complex for first scene)
- Generous restoration (recover fully)
- No time pressure (scene doesn't expire)

### 10.3.2 A2: Meet Constable in Westmarch (45-60 minutes)

**Narrative Context**: Arrive in Westmarch, small town with constable's office. Constable investigating mill incident, needs help gathering information. Player conducts first investigation, learns Mental challenge basics.

**Mechanical Objectives**:
1. Introduce stat gating (Insight 3 path visible, shows gap if locked)
2. Teach gap display ("Need Insight 3, you have 2, need 1 more")
3. Introduce first Mental challenge (easy difficulty, forgiving thresholds)
4. Teach challenge basics (ACT/OBSERVE action pair, Progress toward threshold)
5. Show OnSuccess/OnFailure branching (different paths, both advance)
6. Introduce B-stories (side content for resources)

**Structure**: 4 situations, branching structure

**Situation 1: Meet Constable** (Constable's office)
- Choice A: Authority 3 path (demonstrate professional respect)
- Choice B: Pay 5 coins for information access (standard approach)
- Choice C: Insight 3 path (analytic approach, most players locked)
- Choice D: Volunteer to help (guaranteed, establishes cooperative relationship)
- Outcome: All paths grant access, constable explains situation, advance to Situation 2

**Situation 2: Begin Investigation** (Mill exterior)
- Choice A: Insight 3 path (systematic analysis) - MANY PLAYERS LOCKED
- Choice B: Pay worker 8 coins for information (bypass investigation)
- Choice C: Mental challenge (investigate using ACT/OBSERVE mechanics) - TUTORIAL FOR THIS
- Choice D: Ask around slowly (3 time blocks, guaranteed information)
- Outcome:
  - Success paths → Situation 3A (strong evidence)
  - Challenge success → Situation 3A (strong evidence)
  - Challenge failure → Situation 3B (partial evidence)
  - Fallback → Situation 3B (partial evidence)

**Situation 3A: Report Strong Evidence** (Constable's office)
- Present findings, constable impressed
- Gain 2 Understanding, constable relationship +2
- Unlock "competent_investigator" tag
- Advance to Situation 4

**Situation 3B: Report Partial Evidence** (Constable's office)
- Present incomplete findings, constable understanding
- Gain 1 Understanding, constable relationship +1
- No tag granted
- Advance to Situation 4

**Situation 4: Conclude** (Constable's office)
- Constable suggests next destination (Northreach)
- Player receives small payment (10 coins)
- Scene completes, A3 spawns, Northreach region unlocked

**What Player Learns**:
- Stat gating visible (Insight 3 path shows exact requirement)
- Gap display ("Need 1 more Insight to unlock")
- Mental challenges (ACT generates Leads, OBSERVE follows Leads)
- Challenge success/failure both progress (no soft-lock)
- Branching outcomes (strong vs partial evidence)
- B-stories available (can explore Westmarch for resources)

**Safety Nets**:
- Easy Mental challenge (Progress threshold 10, starting Attention 18)
- Failure still advances (partial evidence sufficient)
- Multiple paths (if challenge too hard, use money/fallback)
- No time pressure (investigation doesn't expire)

### 10.3.3 A3: Traveling Scholar Encounter (60-75 minutes)

**Narrative Context**: On road to Northreach, encounter traveling scholar. Scholar injured, needs help. Multi-situation arc: Assess situation, provide aid, build relationship, part ways with mutual respect.

**Mechanical Objectives**:
1. Introduce multi-situation scenes (4 situations forming coherent arc)
2. Teach Social challenges (SPEAK/LISTEN, Momentum/Doubt mechanics)
3. Show relationship building (StoryCubes accumulation)
4. Demonstrate time pressure (scholar needs timely help)
5. Introduce Physical challenges (EXECUTE/ASSESS, Breakthrough/Danger)
6. Show all three challenge types available

**Structure**: 4 situations, linear with conditional paths

**Situation 1: Assess Scholar's Situation** (Roadside)
- Choice A: Insight 4 path (quick diagnosis)
- Choice B: Pay 12 coins for healing supplies (reliable approach)
- Choice C: Cunning 3 path (improvise solution)
- Choice D: Tend carefully without supplies (slow, guaranteed)
- Outcome: Scholar stabilized, advance to Situation 2

**Situation 2: Provide Assistance** (Camp)
- If player has healing supplies: Better options available
- Choice A: Physical challenge (move scholar to shelter)
- Choice B: Social challenge (comfort and reassure scholar)
- Choice C: Pay for cart transport (15 coins, avoid challenges)
- Choice D: Wait for scholar to recover (4 time blocks, safe)
- Outcome: Scholar grateful, advance to Situation 3

**Situation 3: Evening Conversation** (Shelter)
- Scholar shares knowledge, builds rapport
- Choice A: Rapport 4 path (deep conversation, best bond)
- Choice B: Ask about journey (standard conversation)
- Choice C: Social challenge (earn scholar's trust)
- Choice D: Rest separately (minimal interaction)
- Outcome: Scholar relationship +1 to +3 (depends on path), advance to Situation 4

**Situation 4: Morning Departure** (Roadside)
- Scholar offers gift: Training opportunity OR rare item
- Choice A: Accept training (stat +1, costs time)
- Choice B: Accept item (useful equipment)
- Choice C: Decline politely (scholar appreciates humility)
- Choice D: Suggest traveling together (scholar +2, costs time)
- Outcome: Scene completes, procedural continuation triggered

**What Player Learns**:
- Multi-situation arcs (4 situations forming complete story)
- Social challenges (SPEAK/LISTEN, Momentum toward goal)
- Physical challenges (EXECUTE/ASSESS, Breakthrough toward victory)
- All three challenge types available (Mental from A2, Social/Physical here)
- Relationship building meaningful (scholar bond unlocks benefits)
- Time pressure real (scholar needs timely help, delays matter)
- Procedural continuation begins (A4+ generated procedurally)

**Safety Nets**:
- Challenges optional (can use money/fallback paths)
- Failure not catastrophic (scholar understanding even if help imperfect)
- Multiple relationship paths (conversation OR challenge OR time investment)
- Generous rewards (training OR item OR enhanced relationship)

### 10.3.4 Post-A3: Procedural Continuation

After A3 completes, procedural generation takes over. A4+ scenes generated using archetypes + categorical properties + AI narrative enrichment.

**Transition**:
- No announcement ("Tutorial complete")
- Seamless shift (A4 feels like natural continuation)
- Same structural guarantees (four-choice pattern, no soft-locks)
- Expanding scope (local → regional → continental → cosmic)

**What Changes**:
- Content generation (procedural not authored)
- Margins tighten (safety nets removed)
- Time pressure increases (scenes expire)
- Economic pressure (tight margins maintained)
- Complexity deepens (multi-system interactions)

**What Stays Same**:
- Four-choice pattern (guaranteed progression)
- Perfect information (costs visible)
- Build diversity (all specializations viable)
- Strategic depth (resource trade-offs)

### 10.3.5 Expandable to A10 (Future Development)

Current architecture supports expanding tutorial to A10+ authored scenes before procedural continuation.

**Potential A4-A10 Objectives**:
- A4: First faction encounter (faction relationships, reputation)
- A5: Route travel with Scenes (travel interruptions, route events)
- A6: Economic crisis (tight margins, bankruptcy recovery)
- A7: Training systems (NPC bonds unlock training)
- A8: Item systems (equipment, crafting, supplies)
- A9: Calendar events (seasonal changes, timed opportunities)
- A10: Tactical mastery (complex card synergies, advanced strategies)

**Design Flexibility**: Can extend tutorial as long as needed to teach systems. Procedural continuation triggers after final authored scene.

## 10.4 Layered Complexity Introduction

### 10.4.1 First Hour: Strategic Layer Only

**What's Introduced**:
- Resource display (Health, Stamina, Focus, coins, time)
- Four-choice pattern (stat/money/challenge/fallback)
- Perfect information (costs/rewards visible)
- Basic navigation (location → spot → location)
- Guaranteed progression (fallback paths always available)

**What's NOT Introduced**:
- Tactical challenges (too complex)
- Economic pressure (margins generous)
- Time pressure (no expirations)
- Complex multi-system interactions

**Player Experience**: "I understand resources, I see my options, I can make informed choices. This is comfortable."

**Example Scene Structure**:
```
Situation: Negotiate lodging
Display:
  - Resources visible: 12 coins, Health 60/100, Stamina 40/100
  - Four choices shown with costs:
    - Rapport 3: Free (LOCKED, you have Rapport 2)
    - Pay 6 coins: Reliable (will have 6 coins remaining)
    - Help 2 hours: Guaranteed (will advance time 2 segments)
  - Current state vs projected state clear
```

### 10.4.2 Hours 2-3: First Tactical Challenges (Social Only)

**What's Introduced**:
- First challenge type (Social only, not all three)
- Challenge basics (Action/Foundation/Discard pattern)
- Resource management (Initiative from Foundation cards)
- Victory thresholds (Momentum ≥ 12, Doubt < 10)
- Session resources (Resolve consumed when entering)

**What's NOT Introduced**:
- All three challenge types (just Social)
- Complex card synergies (straightforward paths)
- High difficulty (forgiving thresholds)
- Multiple simultaneous challenges

**Safety Nets**:
- Lower Doubt threshold (10 not 8)
- Higher starting Resolve (15 not 12)
- Clearer optimal paths (well-telegraphed)
- Generous Momentum accumulation

**Player Experience**: "Okay, challenges have more complexity. I play cards, build Initiative, accumulate Momentum. I can see the path to victory."

**Example Challenge Structure**:
```
Social Challenge: Persuade innkeeper
Victory: Momentum ≥ 12, Doubt < 10
Starting: Resolve 15, Initiative 0

Turn 1: Play Foundation card (gain Initiative 5)
Turn 2: Play SPEAK card (cost 3 Initiative, gain Momentum 4)
Turn 3: Play LISTEN card (draw 2, reset tempo)
Turn 4: Play SPEAK card (cost 3 Initiative, gain Momentum 5)
Turn 5: Play SPEAK card (cost 4 Initiative, gain Momentum 4)

Result: Momentum 13 (victory), Doubt 4 (safe)
```

### 10.4.3 Hours 4-6: All Three Challenge Types, Specialization Matters

**What's Introduced**:
- Mental challenges (ACT/OBSERVE, Progress/Exposure)
- Physical challenges (EXECUTE/ASSESS, Breakthrough/Danger)
- All three challenge types accessible
- Specialization choices (which stats to build)
- Stat synergies visible (high Insight improves Mental challenges)

**What's NOT Introduced**:
- Full economic pressure (still slightly generous)
- Extreme time pressure (expirations but lenient)
- Advanced card synergies (complex combos)

**Safety Nets Mostly Removed**:
- Challenge thresholds near final values (Progress 13 not 15, but close)
- Economy approaching final tightness (earn 15, spend 13)
- Time pressure increasing (some expirations, but generous windows)

**Player Experience**: "I'm making build choices. My high Insight helps Mental challenges. My low Authority makes confrontation harder. I'm specializing."

**Example Specialization Impact**:

Player A (Insight 5, Authority 2):
```
Mental challenge: Many stat-gated cards available (Insight-bound)
Physical challenge: Standard difficulty
Social challenge (Authority-based): Few stat-gated cards available
```

Player B (Authority 5, Insight 2):
```
Mental challenge: Few stat-gated cards available
Physical challenge: Standard difficulty
Social challenge (Authority-based): Many stat-gated cards available
```

Different strengths. Different weaknesses. Specialization creating build identity.

### 10.4.4 Hour 6+: Full Complexity, Procedural Continuation, Player-Driven Priorities

**What's Introduced**:
- Full economic pressure (tight margins)
- Full time pressure (frequent expirations)
- Advanced card synergies (complex combos)
- Multi-system interactions (economy + time + challenges)
- Procedural A-story continuation (infinite content)

**All Safety Nets Removed**:
- Challenge thresholds final (Progress 15, Doubt 8)
- Economy final (earn 18, premium lodging 12, margins tight)
- Time pressure final (expirations frequent, deadlines real)

**Player Experience**: "Every decision matters. Resources tight. Time scarce. Build specialization critical. I'm optimizing constantly."

**Example Full Complexity**:

Player situation:
```
Resources: 22 coins, Health 45/100, Stamina 30/100, Focus 12/25, Resolve 8/15
Time: Day 12, Morning, 8 segments remaining
Upcoming: A-story scene expires Day 15, B-story opportunity expires Day 14

Strategic calculation:
- Need to rest (Health low, costs 4 segments + 8 coins lodging)
- A-story scene available (costs 3 Resolve, 2 time blocks)
- B-story expires soon (earn 20 coins, costs 3 time blocks)
- Food needed (5 coins, 1 segment)

Options:
1. Rest now, A-story tomorrow (miss B-story expiration)
2. B-story now, rest, A-story tomorrow (tight but possible)
3. A-story now (risky, low Health), rest, B-story tomorrow (recover)

Player chooses Option 2:
- Morning: Do B-story (3 time blocks, earn 20 coins)
- Midday: Rest (4 segments, pay 8 coins lodging, recover)
- Afternoon: Pursue A-story (3 Resolve, advance plot)
- Evening: Final segment for food

Tight margins. Every choice matters. Optimization critical.
```

## 10.5 Perfect Information Display

### 10.5.1 Costs and Rewards Visible Before Selection

**Display Pattern**: Every choice shows exact costs, exact rewards, exact requirements, exact gaps.

**Cost Display**:
```
Coins: -8 (now 22, will have 14)
Stamina: -6 (now 30, will have 24)
Time: 2 time blocks (8 segments remaining, 6 after)
```

**Reward Display**:
```
Health: +20 (now 45, will have 65)
Understanding: +1 (now 8, will have 9)
Scholar relationship: +2 (now 3, will have 5)
```

**Requirement Display (Locked)**:
```
Requires: Authority ≥ 5
You have: Authority 3
Gap: Need 2 more Authority
```

**Requirement Display (Met)**:
```
Requires: Rapport ≥ 4
You have: Rapport 6
Status: UNLOCKED
```

**Why This Works**:
- Player calculates exact outcome
- No surprises after commitment
- Strategic planning possible
- Resource management transparent

### 10.5.2 Stat Thresholds Show Current Value and Gap

**Pattern**: When stat-gated choice locked, show exact requirement and exact gap.

**Example Displays**:

**Gap 1** (Close):
```
"Assert authority"
Requires: Authority 5
You have: Authority 4
Gap: Need 1 more Authority
Status: LOCKED (almost there)
```

**Gap 3** (Far):
```
"Command respect"
Requires: Authority 7
You have: Authority 4
Gap: Need 3 more Authority
Status: LOCKED (significant investment needed)
```

**Met**:
```
"Use diplomatic approach"
Requires: Diplomacy 4
You have: Diplomacy 6
Status: UNLOCKED (qualified)
```

**Why Gaps Matter**:
- Player can plan: "I'm 1 point away, next training session unlocks this"
- Encourages strategic stat investment
- Shows progress toward unlocking paths
- Never mystery gate ("need high stat" too vague)

### 10.5.3 Locked Choices Visible with Requirement Paths

**Principle**: Show locked choices, explain why locked, show how to unlock.

**Display Pattern**:

**Locked Choice Example**:
```
[LOCKED] "Analyze evidence systematically"

Why locked:
  Requires: Insight ≥ 5
  You have: Insight 3
  Gap: 2 more Insight needed

How to unlock:
  - Training with scholar (costs 20 coins + 3 time blocks)
  - Complete investigation B-stories (gain XP, allocate to Insight)
  - Equipment: Magnifying glass (+1 Insight while equipped)
```

**Why Show Locked**:
- Player sees possibilities (knows what they're missing)
- Requirement Inversion Principle (content exists, requirements filter)
- Motivates character building (I want to unlock that path)
- No mystery gates (clear path to unlocking)

### 10.5.4 Resource Changes Immediate and Clear

**Pattern**: After selection, resource changes apply immediately and visibly.

**Before Selection**:
```
Resources:
  Coins: 22
  Health: 45/100
  Stamina: 30/100
  Time: Morning, 8 segments

Choice: "Rest at inn"
  Cost: 8 coins, 4 segments
  Reward: Health +25, Stamina +30
```

**After Selection**:
```
Resources:
  Coins: 14 (-8, as shown)
  Health: 70/100 (+25, as shown)
  Stamina: 60/100 (+30, as shown)
  Time: Morning, 4 segments (4 consumed, as shown)

[Resource changes highlighted briefly]
```

**Why Immediate Feedback**:
- Player sees consequences clearly
- Resource accounting transparent
- No hidden deductions
- Builds trust (game does what it says)

### 10.5.5 Challenge Difficulty Visible Before Entry

**Pattern**: Before entering challenge, show difficulty indicators.

**Mental Challenge Display**:
```
"Investigate mill interior"

Challenge Preview:
  Type: Mental (ACT/OBSERVE)
  Victory: Progress ≥ 15
  Danger: Exposure increases difficulty over time
  Entry Cost: 2 time blocks
  Session Cost: Focus (you have 18, challenge needs ~12-15)
  Your Advantage: Insight 6 (many stat-gated cards available)

Estimated Difficulty: Moderate (within your capability)
```

**Social Challenge Display**:
```
"Persuade magistrate"

Challenge Preview:
  Type: Social (SPEAK/LISTEN)
  Victory: Momentum ≥ 12, Doubt < 8
  Danger: Magistrate loses patience if Doubt reaches 8
  Entry Cost: 3 Resolve (you have 10, will have 7)
  Your Advantage: Rapport 4 (some stat-gated cards available)
  Your Disadvantage: Authority 2 (few authority-based cards)

Estimated Difficulty: Challenging (Rapport helps, low Authority hinders)
```

**Why Preview Matters**:
- Player decides WHETHER to attempt (strategic choice)
- Knows risks before committing
- Can prepare (rest, acquire supplies, build stats)
- No surprise difficulty spikes

## 10.6 Implicit Guidance Mechanisms

### 10.6.1 Route Segment Counts Visible

**Unknown Route** (First visit):
```
Northern Road [UNKNOWN]
- Distance: Unknown (estimate 3-5 segments)
- Danger: Wilderness terrain, expect challenges
- Time: ~2 time blocks
- Cost: ~10-15 stamina

Uncertainty requires buffer resources.
```

**Known Route** (After first journey):
```
Northern Road [KNOWN]
- Distance: 4 segments (exact)
- Danger: 2 dangerous segments (positions 2, 4)
- Time: 2 time blocks (exact)
- Cost: 8 stamina (2 per segment)
- Events: 1 random event at segment 3

Can plan precisely.
```

**What Player Learns**:
- Route learning reduces uncertainty
- Known routes enable optimization
- First journey teaches route structure
- Subsequent journeys more efficient

**Guidance**: Travel routes multiple times to master efficient navigation.

### 10.6.2 Fixed Environmental Segments Face-Up After First Visit

**First Visit** (Unknown):
```
Route Segment 2 [FACE-DOWN]
- Unknown terrain
- Unknown challenges
- Player explores cautiously
```

**Second Visit** (Known):
```
Route Segment 2 [FACE-UP]
- Terrain: Forest (known)
- Challenge: Physical obstacle (known location)
- Player prepares appropriately
```

**What Player Learns**:
- First journey is exploration (discovery)
- Subsequent journeys are optimized (knowledge)
- Some segments random, some fixed
- Fixed segments learned, random segments always variable

**Guidance**: Master high-traffic routes for efficient repeated travel.

### 10.6.3 NPC Bond Levels Show Mechanical Benefits

**Bond Display**:
```
Elena (Innkeeper)
Bond Level: 3 (Strong friendship)

Benefits:
  - Lodging discount: 6 coins → 4 coins
  - Free meal once per day
  - Rumors and information shared freely
  - Next tier at bond 5: Training available

How to improve:
  - Help with inn tasks (bond +1)
  - Bring requested items (bond +2)
  - Complete related B-stories (bond +1)
```

**What Player Learns**:
- Bonds have mechanical benefits (not just narrative)
- Higher bonds unlock more benefits
- Clear path to improving bonds
- Investment in relationships pays off

**Guidance**: Build bonds with NPCs strategically based on services needed.

### 10.6.4 Economic Feedback Loop (Profit Margins Signal Optimization)

**Suboptimal Play**:
```
B-story earnings: 15 coins
Expenses: Lodging 12 + Food 5 + Travel 3 = 20 coins
Net: -5 coins (deficit)

[Warning: Expenses exceeding income, adjust strategy]
```

**Optimal Play**:
```
B-story earnings: 18 coins
Expenses: Basic lodging 8 + Food 5 + Efficient travel 2 = 15 coins
Net: +3 coins (surplus)

[Comfortable margin maintained]
```

**What Player Learns**:
- Premium options expensive (luxury lodging 40 coins)
- Basic options adequate (basic lodging 8 coins)
- Optimization matters (travel efficiency, lodging choice)
- Sustainable margins achievable with planning

**Guidance**: Track profit margins. Adjust spending if running deficits.

### 10.6.5 Challenge Difficulty Shows Stat Requirements

**Mental Challenge Card** (Before Entry):
```
"Systematic Analysis" card
- Requires: Insight ≥ 5
- Effect: Progress +6, Generate 3 Leads
- Status: LOCKED (you have Insight 3)

[Visible during preview, shows gap]
```

**After Training** (Insight 5):
```
"Systematic Analysis" card
- Requires: Insight ≥ 5
- Effect: Progress +6, Generate 3 Leads
- Status: UNLOCKED

[Now available during challenge]
```

**What Player Learns**:
- Higher stats unlock better cards
- Specialization improves challenge performance
- Can preview cards before entering (informed decision)
- Training investment pays off in tactical layer

**Guidance**: Build stats aligned with preferred challenge types.

## 10.7 No Hand-Holding

### 10.7.1 No Quest Markers

**Not Present**:
- Glowing indicators showing "go here"
- Arrows pointing to objectives
- Automatic waypoints to quest locations
- Mandatory tutorial sequences

**What Exists Instead**:
- Narrative hints: NPCs mention locations
- Perfect information: Requirements visible
- State-based discovery: Content appears when eligible
- Player exploration: Find opportunities naturally

**Example**:

Traditional RPG (AVOID):
```
[QUEST MARKER: Go to mill]
[ARROW: Points to mill on map]
[WAYPOINT: Auto-routes to mill]
[MANDATORY: Must complete to progress]
```

Wayfarer (CORRECT):
```
Constable: "Strange things at the old mill. Worth investigating if you're curious."
[No marker, no arrow, no waypoint]
[Mill appears on map as discovered location]
[Player chooses to investigate or pursue other content]
```

**Why No Markers**:
- Player explores naturally (not following instructions)
- Discovery feels earned (not directed)
- Multiple paths available (not linear progression)
- Agency preserved (player decides priorities)

### 10.7.2 No Optimal Path Highlighting

**Not Present**:
- Recommended choices marked
- "Best" option indicated
- Difficulty color-coding (easy/hard)
- Success rate percentages

**What Exists Instead**:
- Perfect information (costs/rewards visible)
- Requirement transparency (stat thresholds shown)
- Player calculates optimal (based on resources and priorities)
- Context determines best choice (no universal optimal)

**Example**:

Hand-Holding Design (AVOID):
```
Choice A: [RECOMMENDED] Pay 10 coins
Choice B: Authority 5 required (85% success rate)
Choice C: [HARD] Social challenge
Choice D: [FALLBACK] Wait 3 days
```

Wayfarer Design (CORRECT):
```
Choice A: Rapport 4 required (you have 6, UNLOCKED)
Choice B: Pay 10 coins (you have 22, affordable)
Choice C: Social challenge (costs 3 Resolve, success OR failure advances)
Choice D: Wait 3 days (zero cost, guaranteed, time-intensive)

[Player determines optimal based on situation]
```

**Why No Highlighting**:
- Player makes informed decisions (not following instructions)
- Optimal varies by context (no universal best)
- Build diversity (different builds prefer different paths)
- Skill expression (optimization is player skill)

### 10.7.3 No Hidden Gotchas

**Not Present**:
- Surprise consequences after commitment
- Hidden requirements discovered after attempt
- Unadvertised resource deductions
- Locked content with unclear requirements

**What Exists Instead**:
- Perfect information principle (all visible)
- Consequences shown before selection
- Requirements transparent (exact thresholds)
- Clear paths to unlocking (visible progression)

**Example**:

Hidden Gotcha (FORBIDDEN):
```
Choice: "Accept magistrate's deal"
Display: "Gain assistance"
Hidden: Lose 5 Reputation, gain "corrupted" tag, lock good endings

[Player discovers after commitment, feels cheated]
```

Perfect Information (CORRECT):
```
Choice: "Accept magistrate's deal"
Display:
  Immediate: Gain magistrate's assistance
  Consequences: -5 Reputation, gain "pragmatic_alliance" tag
  Future: Blocks "righteous_path" scenes, enables "practical_path" scenes
  Trade-off: Power vs principles

[Player sees exact trade-off before deciding]
```

**Why No Gotchas**:
- Player makes informed decisions (not guessing)
- Trust maintained (game does what it says)
- Experimentation safe (no surprise punishments)
- Strategic planning possible (calculate outcomes)

### 10.7.4 No Punishment for Experimentation

**Design Guarantees**:
- Four-choice pattern (fallback always available)
- Challenge failure advances (setback, not block)
- Resources recoverable (can earn more coins, restore Health)
- No permanent lockouts (builds remain viable)

**Example Safe Experimentation**:

Player tries expensive choice:
```
Choice: Pay 20 coins for premium service
Current coins: 22
After: 2 coins (very low)

[Tight margin, but can recover via B-stories]
```

Player recovers:
```
Do B-story: Earn 18 coins
After: 20 coins (comfortable again)

[Experimentation had cost, but recoverable]
```

**Why Experimentation Encouraged**:
- Failure not catastrophic (can recover)
- Learning valuable (understand systems)
- Discovery rewarded (find efficient paths)
- Player agency (safe to try approaches)

### 10.7.5 No Forced Tutorial

**Design Flexibility**:
- Can skip A1-A3 if experienced (jump to A4+)
- Can replay tutorial scenes if needed (re-learn systems)
- Can explore B-stories before A-story (no forced sequence)
- Can build character as preferred (no mandatory path)

**How Skipping Works**:

New player:
```
Start → A1 (learn basics) → A2 (learn investigation) → A3 (learn relationships) → A4+ (full game)
```

Experienced player:
```
Start → [SKIP TUTORIAL] → A4+ (full game immediately)
[Assumes understanding of systems]
```

**Why Optional**:
- Respects experienced players (no tedious rehash)
- Onboarding for new players (gradual learning)
- Replayability (skip on subsequent playthroughs)
- Player agency (choose engagement level)

## 10.8 Discovery Rewards

### 10.8.1 Route Shortcuts from NPC Bonds

**Pattern**: Building relationship with NPC unlocks shortcut routes.

**Example**:

Initial route:
```
Westmarch → Northreach
Distance: 6 segments
Time: 3 time blocks
Cost: 12 stamina
```

After building bond with Elena (level 5):
```
Elena: "My cousin runs ferry service. I'll write you a letter of introduction."

Unlocked: Ferry Route (shortcut)
Westmarch → Northreach (via ferry)
Distance: 2 segments
Time: 1 time block
Cost: 8 coins (ferry fee) + 4 stamina

Trade-off: Costs coins, saves time and stamina
```

**What Player Learns**:
- Relationships unlock alternatives
- Shortcuts have trade-offs (coin cost vs time/stamina savings)
- Investment in NPCs pays off mechanically
- Strategic relationship building matters

**Guidance**: Build bonds with NPCs in high-traffic areas for travel shortcuts.

### 10.8.2 Stat Synergies Discovered Through Play

**Pattern**: Player discovers stat combinations unlock better paths.

**Example Discovery**:

Player with Insight 6, Cunning 5:
```
Mental investigation scene:
- "Systematic analysis" path (Insight 6) - UNLOCKED
- "Subtle observation" path (Cunning 5) - UNLOCKED
- "Intuitive deduction" path (Insight 6 + Cunning 4) - UNLOCKED

Three optimal paths available (high specialization payoff)
```

Player with Insight 4, Cunning 4:
```
Mental investigation scene:
- "Systematic analysis" path (Insight 6) - LOCKED
- "Subtle observation" path (Cunning 5) - LOCKED
- "Intuitive deduction" path (Insight 6 + Cunning 4) - LOCKED

Must use expensive/challenge/fallback paths (generalist disadvantage)
```

**What Player Learns**:
- Specialization unlocks more paths
- Stat combinations create synergies
- Focused builds have advantages
- Generalist builds sacrifice accessibility for flexibility

**Guidance**: Specialize in 2-3 stats for consistent path access.

### 10.8.3 Economic Optimization Mastery

**Pattern**: Player discovers efficient spending patterns.

**Novice Economy**:
```
Income: 15 coins per B-story
Expenses:
  - Premium lodging: 12 coins (luxury)
  - Premium food: 8 coins (restaurant)
  - Premium travel: 5 coins (carriage)
Total: 25 coins (deficit -10, unsustainable)
```

**Expert Economy**:
```
Income: 15 coins per B-story
Expenses:
  - Basic lodging: 6 coins (adequate)
  - Standard food: 5 coins (sufficient)
  - Foot travel: 0 coins (costs stamina instead)
Total: 11 coins (surplus +4, sustainable)

Strategic premium purchases:
  - Premium lodging when Health critical (emergency use)
  - Premium food when time scarce (efficiency trade-off)
  - Carriage when stamina depleted (recovery alternative)
```

**What Player Learns**:
- Basic options adequate (not inferior)
- Premium options situational (emergency or efficiency)
- Sustainable margins through optimization
- Strategic spending beats habitual premium

**Guidance**: Use basic options routinely, premium options strategically.

### 10.8.4 Tactical Skill Improvement

**Pattern**: Challenge success rates improve with card play skill.

**Novice Tactical Play**:
```
Mental Challenge
Turn 1: Play ACT card (generate 2 Leads)
Turn 2: Play ACT card (generate 2 Leads, but not enough Attention)
Turn 3: Waste turn (no good cards)
Turn 4: Play OBSERVE (draw only 2 Details, Leads wasted)
Result: Progress 8/15 (failure, inefficient)
```

**Expert Tactical Play**:
```
Mental Challenge
Turn 1: Play ACT card (generate 2 Leads)
Turn 2: Play ACT card (generate 3 Leads, total 5 Leads)
Turn 3: Play OBSERVE (draw 5 Details, maximize Leads)
Turn 4: Play high-value ACT (build Progress 12, near threshold)
Turn 5: Play finishing ACT (Progress 16, victory)
Result: Progress 16/15 (success, efficient)
```

**What Player Learns**:
- Lead accumulation matters (maximize before OBSERVE)
- Card sequencing matters (Foundation before expensive cards)
- Resource management (don't waste Attention)
- Victory thresholds reachable (optimization enables success)

**Guidance**: Accumulate builder resources before spending session resources.

### 10.8.5 Archetype Pattern Recognition

**Pattern**: Player recognizes repeating patterns, predicts structure.

**After Multiple Services**:

Player recognizes service flow pattern:
```
"This is a service scene. It'll be:
1. Negotiation (stat/money/challenge/fallback)
2. Execution (choose recovery focus)
3. Departure (relationship or speed)

I know this structure. I'll negotiate with coins (save stats for later), choose mental-focused recovery (need Focus), quick departure (save time)."
```

**After Multiple Investigations**:

Player recognizes investigation pattern:
```
"This is hub-and-spoke investigation. I'll:
1. Explore all three leads (gather maximum evidence)
2. Return to convergence (present complete picture)
3. Get optimal conclusion (best Understanding gain)

Worth the time investment for full evidence."
```

**What Player Learns**:
- Patterns repeat across game (reusable mental models)
- Structure predictable (can plan ahead)
- Archetypes have conventions (four choices, three phases)
- Recognition enables optimization (efficient decision-making)

**Guidance**: Learn archetype patterns for faster strategic planning.
