# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## AUTO-DOCUMENTATION MANDATE

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW REMINDERS:**
1. ✅ **ALWAYS read existing 'claude.md' first** - Understand current architecture state
2. ✅ **ALWAYS update 'claude.md' after discovering new information** - Maintain comprehensive documentation  
3. ✅ **NEVER proceed without updating documentation** - When new insights are discovered
4. ✅ **Document architectural changes immediately** - Track all relationships and patterns
5. ✅ **VERIFY DOCUMENTATION IN EVERY COMMIT** - Follow post-commit validation workflow
6. 🧹 **REGULARLY CULL AND UPDATE claude.md** - Remove outdated information, consolidate sections, keep only current relevant details

## DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

### CODE WRITING PRINCIPLES
- Do not leave comments in code that are not TODOs or SERIOUSLY IMPORTANT
- After each change, run the tests to check for broken functionality. Never commit while tests are failing
