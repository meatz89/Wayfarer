# Wayfarer: Verisimilitude Specialist Perspective

## The Authentic Medieval Messenger Experience

### Why Every Mechanic Reflects Reality

**The Queue as Physical Satchel**
Your delivery queue isn't an abstract list but your actual messenger satchel with physical constraints. Letters have weight (1-3 units) representing bulk - a sealed scroll weighs less than a package. The 8-slot, 12-weight limit represents what you can physically carry. Position matters because you pack things in order, and reaching the bottom requires unpacking everything above - hence why only position 1 can be delivered without reorganization.

**Displacement as Social Cost**
When you rearrange your satchel to prioritize one letter over another, you're making a visible social choice. The sender whose letter gets displaced sees this (medieval communities are small, word travels). Burning tokens represents the actual relationship damage from publicly deprioritizing someone's urgent need. The more positions you move something up, the more people see you shuffling their concerns aside.

**Travel Routes as Real Infrastructure**
Medieval cities aren't open worlds but networks of controlled routes:
- **Walking routes**: Public streets anyone can use, slow but free
- **Cart routes**: Merchant roads requiring relationships or payment
- **Private routes**: Noble passages requiring special permits
- **Shadow routes**: Hidden paths known only to those with connections

Transport types reflect real options:
- **Walking** (30 min): On foot through crowded streets
- **Hired cart** (15 min, 2 coins): Merchant wagon with driver
- **Private carriage** (10 min, 5 coins): Noble transport
- **Shadow passage** (instant, requires Shadow 5): Secret tunnels

**Locations Within Locations**
A medieval district isn't homogeneous. The Market Quarter contains:
- The main square (where merchants gather)
- Side alleys (where shadowy figures lurk)
- Guild halls (requiring Commerce relationships)
- Storage warehouses (requiring special access)

Finding NPCs requires knowing not just their district but their specific spot within it, discovered through observation or prior knowledge.

### Letter Types Reflect Medieval Communication

**Standard Delivery Letters**
These are the bread and butter - sealed messages between parties who can't or won't meet directly. The sender trusts you not to read them (though Shadow relationships might enable peeking). Deadlines represent real urgency - marriage proposals, business deals, and political arrangements all have time sensitivity.

**Access Permits**
Physical documents that grant passage. A noble's seal allowing access to castle grounds. A merchant guild token permitting use of trade routes. These are valuable items that you sacrifice (literally hand over to guards) to permanently unlock routes. This isn't gamey - it's how medieval society controlled movement.

**Introduction Letters**
Formal letters of introduction were essential in medieval society. You couldn't just walk up to a noble and start talking. An introduction letter from a mutual connection establishes your credibility. Mechanically unlocking new NPCs represents this social protocol.

**Standing Obligations as Medieval Oaths**
When you create an obligation with a desperate NPC, you're making a formal oath - a serious matter in medieval society. Breaking oaths had real consequences:
- **Trust obligations**: Personal oaths of friendship
- **Commerce obligations**: Formal business contracts
- **Status obligations**: Public vows before witnesses
- **Shadow obligations**: Blood oaths and secret pacts

These modify queue rules because breaking them damages your reputation across the entire community.

### Why Relationships Gate Routes

**Physical Access Control**
- Castle gates literally won't open without proper status
- Merchant caravans won't take unknown passengers
- Shadow networks require proven trustworthiness
- Noble carriages are invitation-only

**Social Navigation**
Higher relationships don't just make things easier - they grant actual access. A merchant with Commerce 5 knows which guards accept bribes, which routes avoid bandits, and when merchant caravans depart. This knowledge IS the relationship benefit.

### The Daily Messenger Life

**Morning Scramble**
You wake at 6 AM with multiple people needing letters delivered. Some are desperate (deadlines approaching), others calculating (plenty of time). You must observe who's where, plan your route, and manage your limited satchel space. This isn't arbitrary - it's the actual life of a medieval messenger.

**Reputation Cascades**
Every successful delivery builds reputation with both sender and recipient. Every failure damages it. Word spreads - merchants talk, nobles gossip, shadows whisper. Your reputation (tokens) determines who trusts you with important letters.

**Time as Currency**
Medieval time was measured by church bells and sun position. When you spend 30 minutes walking versus 10 minutes in a carriage, you're making real trade-offs. Deadlines tick down continuously because the wedding, the trial, the departure - these events won't wait.

### Authentic Conversation Integration

Letters must be personally accepted and delivered through conversation because:
- Medieval society was built on personal trust
- Important documents required verbal confirmation
- Recipients needed to know the messenger (for reply purposes)
- Payment happened face-to-face

You can't just drop letters in mailboxes - you must look people in the eye, accept responsibility, and confirm delivery.

### Why This Creates Meaningful Gameplay

Every mechanic reinforces that you're a real person navigating real social dynamics in a believable medieval city. The pressure isn't artificial but emerges from authentic constraints:
- Physical limits on what you can carry
- Social consequences for prioritization choices
- Geographic realities of city navigation
- Time pressure from real urgencies
- Reputation effects from reliability

The beauty is that these authentic constraints create exactly the kind of tactical puzzle that makes great gameplay. You're not optimizing abstract systems but navigating the actual challenges a medieval messenger would face, making every decision feel grounded and meaningful.
