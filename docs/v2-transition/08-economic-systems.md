# Wayfarer V2 Economic Systems: Creating Meaningful Money Sinks

## Executive Summary

The V2 economic system transforms money from an accumulation game to a strategic resource. By introducing consumable supplies, information services, temporary advantages, and investment opportunities, money becomes a tool for preparation and progress rather than a score to maximize. Every coin spent represents a strategic choice about how to approach upcoming challenges.

## The Economic Problem

### Current V1 Issues
- Money accumulates infinitely after initial equipment purchases
- No ongoing expenses create pressure
- Weight management more limiting than cost
- Late game money becomes meaningless
- No strategic decisions about spending

### V2 Design Goals
- Every expedition requires economic planning
- Money enables different strategic approaches
- Failure has economic consequences
- Success requires investment
- Always something worth saving for

## Core Economic Loop

```
Work Jobs Generate Income
    ↓
Purchase Preparation Resources
    ↓
Attempt Investigations/Travel
    ↓
Success: Rewards > Investment (profit)
Failure: Rewards < Investment (loss)
    ↓
Reinvest or Rebuild
```

### Key Principles

1. **Preparation Costs**: Every investigation attempt requires investment
2. **Risk/Reward Balance**: Higher investment enables safer approaches
3. **Recovery Possible**: Can always work to rebuild funds
4. **Strategic Variety**: Multiple spending strategies viable
5. **No Death Spiral**: Minimum viable approach always available

## Player Psychology

### Early Game Feel
"Every coin counts. Do I buy the rope or the lantern? Can I afford the guide? Maybe I should work one more day..."

### Mid Game Feel
"I can afford basics, but the good services are expensive. Should I invest in better equipment or hire help? Time to specialize..."

### Late Game Feel
"Operations run smoothly, but these investments are tempting. Do I expand the business or upgrade the base? Empire building time..."

### Always Present
"What's the smart spend here? How much risk can I afford? What's my backup plan if this fails?"

## Example Economic Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Desperate Start
- Starting coins: 15
- Need investigation supplies: 40 coins
- Solution: Work 2 days (40 coins), buy minimal supplies (15 coins), attempt with 50% success chance

### Scenario 2: The Calculated Risk
- Current coins: 120
- Investigation opportunity: High reward but dangerous
- Decision: Full supplies (40), Information (50), Keep reserve (30) for recovery

### Scenario 3: The Investment Dilemma
- Current coins: 500
- Choice: New equipment set (300) OR Business venture (400) OR Multiple investigations (500)
- Each path viable but mutually exclusive

### Scenario 4: The Failure Spiral
- Failed investigation: -80 coins
- Current coins: 20
- Recovery: Work (20/day) + Sell items (40) + Borrow (30) = Back in action in 2 days

## Conclusion

The V2 economic system transforms money from score to strategy. Through carefully balanced sinks—consumables that enable success, services that save time, investments that build futures—every coin becomes a decision. The system creates pressure without punishment, choice without paralysis, and meaning without grind. Players will remember not how much money they had, but what they chose to do with it.

This economic design ensures that whether players are scraping together coins for basic supplies or deciding between major investments, money remains a crucial strategic resource that shapes how they approach Wayfarer's challenges. The path to success isn't about accumulating wealth—it's about spending it wisely.
